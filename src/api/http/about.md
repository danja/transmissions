(This is partially implemented but not properly wired together or tested).

The server components start a long-running http process. When called with a HTTP POST the payload will be processed by the app. 

For example using the app defined in `src/apps/test/echo`, the command 
```sh
./trans -w -p 5000 echo
```
Should start a server on `http://localhost:5000/echo`. The HTTP API version of `echo` should wait for HTTP POST calls, in which there should be a `message` parameter. An instance of the `echo` app will be give this as message. After the processors in the app have been run through, the HTTP server should return the resulting `message` object as payload. 

If the calling message contains the single value `{ "system":"stop"}` the HTTP server should shut down gracefully.

There are also simple command-line test clients running against `echo` and the stop call (two versions : using curl & programmatic with node) under examples/http/ as well as unit and integration tests using Vitest (ES modules) in the existing test infrastructure.

### Notes
Other options include :
```sh
cd ~/hyperdata/transmissions/
./trans --verbose --web --port 4200 echo

./trans -v -w -p 4200 echo

./trans -v -w -t -p 4200 echo

cd /flow/hyperdata/transmissions && ./trans -w -p 4400 echo && examples/http/echo-curl.sh

```

compare with :

```sh
./trans  -v echo
```

TODO add HTTP GET where the response is the app's associated `about.md` file.
