{"subjectLine":"foaf & genealogy","fromName":"Danny Ayers","messageText":"I just spotted a post on the GenealogyXML at yahoogroups.com list suggesting\nTopic Maps for genealogy data. RDF *should* be really good for this, with\nthe one possible difficulty being how to manage the \"the gravestone says he\ndied in 2003\" kind of data given the state of messages & reification.\n\nI reckon the bits needed for simple genealogy should sit very nicely\nalongside FOAF, and it would allow the foafnaut to do families too.\n\nA quick Google doesn't find much - there is an old DAML vocab at\nhttp://orlando.drc.com/daml/Ontology/Genealogy/current/\n\nalso rdf2ge12.zip RDF to GEDCOM ...\nhttp://ftp.cac.psu.edu/genealogy/paf/INDEX.html\n\n\n(fyi, I know close to nothing about gen. - I just thought family trees would\nmake a good example use of SVG for 'Unleashed', but it started getting too\nbig to fit in the space)\n\nCheers,\nDanny.\n\n-----------\nDanny Ayers\n\nSemantic Web Log :\nhttp://www.citnames.com/blog\n\n\"The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne.\" - Chaucer"}
