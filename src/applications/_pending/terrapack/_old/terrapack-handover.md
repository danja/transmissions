# terrapack Project Handover Document

## Project Overview

The terrapack project is designed to consolidate repository content into AI-friendly formats, similar to repomix. It processes source code and other text files into a single document optimized for large language model analysis.

## Core Components

### FileContainer (src/processors/terrapack/FileContainer.js)

The FileContainer processor serves as the central aggregation component. It accumulates file contents and metadata into a structured format, maintaining a summary of file types and counts. The container tracks file paths relative to the project root and preserves file metadata like timestamps and types.

### CommentStripper (src/processors/terrapack/CommentStripper.js)

This utility removes comments from source code files while preserving the actual code. It supports multiple programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, and C-family languages. The processor handles both single-line and multi-line comments appropriately for each language.

### PackerProcessorsFactory (src/processors/terrapack/PackerProcessorsFactory.js)

The factory class manages processor instantiation, integrating the terrapack components into the Transmissions framework. It currently handles creation of the FileContainer processor and may be extended for additional processors.

## Integration Tests

The test suite includes integration tests verifying the full pipeline functionality, focusing on file reading, processing, and output generation. Test files are located in tests/integration/file-container.spec.js.

## Configuration

The application uses a TTL-based configuration system defining:

- File inclusion/exclusion patterns
- Output file settings
- Processing options like comment stripping

## Future Development Areas

1. Token counting functionality
2. Security scanning for sensitive data
3. Binary file handling
4. Additional output format templating

## Test Applications

### FileContainer Test (src/applications/test_file-container/)

A standalone test application demonstrating the FileContainer processor's functionality. It processes test files through the container and generates JSON output, useful for verification and development.

## Critical Notes

- The system expects text files as input; binary files are currently excluded
- File paths are processed relative to the project root
- Comment stripping is language-aware but conservative to prevent code removal

## Dependencies

- Standard Node.js fs/promises for file operations
- RDF components for configuration
- Transmissions framework core classes
