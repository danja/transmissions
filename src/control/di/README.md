# Basic Dependency Injection
## In less than 100 lines of pure, ES6 JavaScript

This is a very bare-bones dependency injector implementation based on the ES6 classes. It's meant to illustrate the feasibility and benefits of using a service-based dependency injector for Node.js/JavaScript applications.

I discuss this project in greater depth in my blog post [here](https://garrettmills.dev/blog/2019/11/16/Dependency-Injection-in-Less-Than-100-Lines-of-Pure-JavaScript/).
