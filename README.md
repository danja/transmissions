# transmissions

After _No Code_ and _Lo Code_ comes _Marginally Less Code_

**Transmissions** is a micro-framework which will simplify construction of small data processing applications in JavaScript (assuming you are already familiar with JavaScript and RDF).

A bit like `make` or a `package.json` builder.

### Status

The code is in active development, ie. **not stable**, subject to arbitrary changes.

Documentation will be lagging behind code, be incomplete and out of date.

**2024-03-24** : a couple of simple data processing pipelines working and wired up as Jasmine e2e tests in place; started to develop actually useful pipelines for [foaf-archive](https://github.com/danja/foaf-archive) project

## Motivation

This was prompted by something of a ~~perfect storm~~ serendipitous convergence of ideas, requirements and environment.

- I had the realization that much of the software I want to write in the near future has the same basic high level **architecture** : pipeline-like, ie. a series of steps each of which transform data from one form into another ([Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)>)).
- **Pipelines** are approachable using concepts from Design Patterns like [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), [Inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) etc. A key benefit of such patterns is that, because the components are loosely coupled, they can largely be developed in isolation as small standalone units before integration into a larger application.
- **Large Language Models** currently struggle with large codebases and complex architectures (mostly due to [context window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#Prompt_engineering,_attention_mechanism,_and_context_window) limitations). But they are very good at building small, simple, self-contained units of code.

reused in different contexts.

_I'm writing this with GitHub Copilot enabled for markdown, which can be helpful, but sometimes it goes off on one... After the first point above it offered :_

_... which is a little over the top, but it's a fair list of things that might be helped by a micro-framework like this. Remarkably the first 5 are pretty much my immediate intended uses for this._

**Docs below need updating**

for later :

The [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer) uses [Components.js](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to specify how modules and components need to be wired together at runtime. Components.js is a dependency injection framework for JavaScript applications.

## What it is

A low-level system for data processing pipelines/networks. Wherever convenient functionality will be defined declaratively with JSON-LD configuration files.

Dependency injection is used internally to allow loose coupling of components.

## What it isn't

There are several sophisticated frameworks for building interfaces between software applications and creating data processing networks. NodeRed, NoFlo etc. This is not one of them. This is much more basic and bare bones, down in the details.

See also [David Booth](https://github.com/dbooth-boston)'s [RDF Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/rdf-pipeline)

_I do eventually want to use this with NodeRed or whatever, but the entities created by transmissions will be at the level of nodes in such networks, not the network itself._

## Motivation

I'm in the process of writing yet another blog engine (Postcraft). I've also started working on a playground for interconnecting intelligent agents in an XMPP multiuser chat environment (Kia). I'm also revising a system for managing a personal knowledge base in the world of LLMs (HKMS). These all share functionality around connectivity to external data/messaging systems and internal data transformation. Might as well write this bit once only, and avoid thinking about software architecture more than I have to.

### Goals

To facilate :

- rapid development of small applications
- reuse of components in a loosely-couple environment
- versatility

### Soft Goals

- performance - low on the list
- scalability - ditto
- security - ditto
