# Transmissions

A mini-framework for data processing workflows

_**please be patient, functioning release planned for Summer Solstice 2025**_

## Status

- **2025-04-28** alas still spending periods broken, but the current target is to make a basically functional, completely test-passing **release on 2025-06-21**. Many parts will still be primitive, but _fingers crossed_ I'll be using it for some genuinely useful purposes by then.
- **2025-03-29** mostly where I want it for v1, but needs a **lot** of cleaning up. Publishing now to npm registry so I don't have to rename later.
- _2025-02-09_ fixing up, aiming for a release (that works away from my own desktop) soon

## Troubleshooting

There are tests of various kinds which may be run as a suite from the command line with :

```sh
npm test
```

For details see tests/about.md
