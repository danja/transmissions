We are in the process of creating a visual editor for `transmission.ttl` pipeline descriptions using the nodeflow library. A lot of code is in place under `src/tools/nodeflow` which is addressed by means of `index.html`. However since the bridging between transmissions and nodeflow will use the relatively heavyweight nodeflow material alongside RDF-Ext and rdfjs libs it seems time to make use of WebPack as a bundler (and for convenience, a dev server).

Please review the project knowledge and think very deeply on how nodeflow can be used, with minimal impact on the existing codebase. First double-check any new code adds functionality without breaking anything, providing Jasmine tests as appropriate (under `tests/api`) then give any code as individual, full source code artifacts, clearly labeled as to where they should be located.
