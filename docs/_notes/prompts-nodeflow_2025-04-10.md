We are in the process of creating a visual editor for `transmission.ttl` pipeline descriptions using the nodeflow library. A lot of code is in place under `src/tools/nodeflow` which is addressed by means of `index.html`. However since the bridging between transmissions and nodeflow will use the relatively heavyweight nodeflow material alongside RDF-Ext and rdfjs libs it seems time to make use of WebPack as a bundler (and for convenience, a dev server).
Please review the project knowledge and think very deeply on how nodeflow can be used, with minimal impact on the existing codebase. First double-check any new code adds functionality without breaking anything, providing Jasmine tests as appropriate (under `tests/api`) then give any code as individual, full source code artifacts, clearly labeled as to where they should be located.

Please refer to project knowledge. We are in the process of creating a visual editor for `transmission.ttl` pipeline descriptions using the nodeflow library. A lot of code is in place under `src/tools/nodeflow` which is addressed by means of `index.html`. Transmissions is a node-based project, some of the libs (eg. RDF-Ext) aren't natively browser-friendly. So compatibility is acheived by packaging with WebPack, see `webpack.config.js` and `package.json`. Right now most of the code is in place but there are many bugs to fix. I'd like you to help me fix them. The procedure will be that you familiarise yourself with the relevant parts of the codebase - the `index.html` in the root of the project and `src/tools/nodeflow/editor.html` are probably good starting points. When you are ready I will show you the first error.
