I've got some modules in a tangle. There are two methods that should be available : fromFile and toFile, each with two variants. When in a node environment, they should be picked up from the 'rdf-utils-fs' library module. When in a browser environment, they should be picked up from 'src/utils/RDFUtilsBrowser.js'. There is a check to see if a browser is in use in 'src/utils/BrowserUtils.js'. There is currently an alias in the webpack config to point to the browser version of the module. I want to use the node version when in a node environment and the browser version when in a browser environment. How can I do this?
