Please keep your responses to a minimum, only show code listings that include your changes. I will upload an ES6 project as a zip file. Please extract the files and save to /mnt/data/
It is in early stages of development and does not work. We need to fix it and get it to support the following functionality.
The purpose of the code is to apply a processing pipeline to text. Services define the individual nodes which are instantiated by dependency injection. The connections between nodes will given declaratively using Connector.js. Here the code should read a file, apply a process to it and save it again. Please examine the code and write tests that will confirm this behaviour. Then fix the code to operate correctly. I will upload the code again. After creating anything new or modifying code, please save to to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Give extremely concise status messages only. After every step, stop and ask me for confirmation. I will pay you $20/month.

We need to fix it to support the following functionality:
The purpose of the code is to apply a processing pipeline to text. Services define the individual nodes which are instantiated by dependency injection. The aim is to make everything very loosely-coupled. Later the pipeline topology will be defined declaratively. As it stands now, the code should read a file, apply a process to it and save it again. After creating anything new or modifying code, please save to to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Give extremely concise status messages only.
