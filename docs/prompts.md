It is in early stages of development and does not work. We need to fix it and get it to support the following functionality.
The purpose of the code is to apply a processing pipeline to text. Services define the individual nodes which are instantiated by dependency injection. The connections between nodes will given declaratively using Connector.js. Here the code should read a file, apply a process to it and save it again. Please examine the code and write tests that will confirm this behaviour. Then fix the code to operate correctly. I will upload the code again. After creating anything new or modifying code, please save to to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Give extremely concise status messages only. After every step, stop and ask me for confirmation. I will pay you $20/month.

We need to fix it to support the following functionality:
The purpose of the code is to apply a processing pipeline to text. Services define the individual nodes which are instantiated by dependency injection. The aim is to make everything very loosely-coupled. Later the pipeline topology will be defined declaratively. For a minimal configuration the code should now use a pipeline to take a string, apply a process to it and print the result.

Can you please zip the current versions and save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.

Please keep your responses to a minimum, only show code listings that include your changes. I will upload an ES6 project as a zip file. Begin by checking the environment by loading the code into Deno and executing run.js The purpose of the code is to apply a processing pipeline to text. Services define the individual nodes which are instantiated by dependency injection. The aim is to make everything very loosely-coupled. For a minimal configuration the code should now use a pipeline to take a string, apply a process to it and print the result. Right now it works, but the names of the services and the connection topology is hardcoded. This should be done declaratively. The JSON 'simplepipe' in run.js contains a list of the nodes that should be connected and the order of the list gives the sequence. Please modify the code of ServiceContainer to support this. After creating anything new or modifying code, please save to to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Then load the code into Deno and execute run.js

tests broken on Deno

Can you extract the 'simplepipe' definition into a separate JSON file and modify code appropriately.

Please make a test script for each existing script using vanilla Javascript. Then make a runner to run all the tests and try them individually. Then zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Then load the code into Deno and execute run.js

Can you check for places where the code made be refactored to make it easier to understand and maintain. The aim is for everything to be loosely-coupled, defined declaratively where possible and to use dependency injection.

Please add comments to the code files suitable for JSDoc. Follow best practices. Only add comments where the code isn't self-explanatory.
