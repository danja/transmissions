Proctor!!! - self-examination functionality (not proctologist)

note surveillance


Transmissions, as an agent, should eat its own dogfood.

Agents have communication skills, agency and intelligence - but the levels of each may be *zero*.

funny
Orchestrator: This word implies a high-level control and direction, which could be fitting for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Director: This word suggests a sense of leadership and guidance, which could work well for a class that manages the construction of an application.
Architect: This word implies a sense of design and planning, which could be fitting for a class that builds an application from scratch.
Builder: This word is straightforward and suggests a sense of construction and creation, which could work well for a class that assembles an application.
Fabricator: This word implies a sense of creation and assembly, which could be fitting for a class that builds an application from a set of instructions.
Constructor: This word is similar to builder, but implies a sense of creation and assembly, which could work well for a class that builds an application.
Compiler: This word implies a sense of taking in instructions and turning them into something executable, which could be fitting for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Interpreter: This word suggests a sense of understanding and executing instructions, which could work well for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Executor: This word implies a sense of taking action and executing instructions, which could be fitting for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Proctor: This word suggests a sense of oversight and guidance, which could work well for a class that manages the construction of an application.

I don't know the word proctor - what does it mean in common usage? how might it be applied in the software context?
In common usage, a proctor is typically a person who supervises or monitors an examination, test, or other assessment to ensure its integrity and fairness. For example, a teacher might act as a proctor for a student taking a test, ensuring that the student doesn't cheat or access unauthorized materials.

In the software context, a proctor could be a class or component that oversees and manages the execution of a program or application. Here are a few ways a proctor might be applied:

Test runner: A proctor could be responsible for running tests, ensuring that they are executed correctly, and reporting the results.
Application launcher: A proctor could be used to launch and manage the execution of an application, ensuring that it is started correctly and runs smoothly.
Environment manager: A proctor could be responsible for setting up and managing the environment in which an application runs, such as configuring dependencies, setting variables, or managing resources.
Execution controller: A proctor could be used to control the execution of an application, pausing, resuming, or terminating it as needed.
Monitoring agent: A proctor could be responsible for monitoring the performance and behavior of an application, detecting and reporting any issues or anomalies.
In the context of your framework code, a proctor could be a class that receives instructions and builds an application, and then oversees its execution, testing, and modification. The proctor would ensure that the application is executed correctly, and that any changes or tests are executed in a controlled and predictable manner.

While the word "proctor" might not be immediately familiar in the software context, it's an interesting and unique term that could add a layer of depth and nuance to your framework's architecture.
