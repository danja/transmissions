I want to add some direct knowledge of the Pulsar-based source code to Claude project knowledge because I want Claude to help me customise and extend it. But it's a very large repo and a project only includes a 200K token context window. I can use repopack on it to reduce a lot of unnecessary material, but I don't know which parts you are already familiar with (maybe from the Atom editor), which parts will be helpful for development and which parts can be ignored.  Have a look at the documentation for repopack and the blog post about projects that are in your Project knowledge. Then look at the attached output of `tree` and advise me.
