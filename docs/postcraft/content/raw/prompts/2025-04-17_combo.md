Please review the codebase in project knowledge and think how to go about making the following. Currently the topology of Transmissions pipelines is effectively limited to sequences and trees because processors only have one input. A new kind of processor is needed, with multiple input connections. The first problem to solve is how to express the connection ports in Transmissions's Turtle. Next, how to handle these in Connector objects. I think a subclass of Processor will also be needed.

:t1 a trn:Transmission ;
    trn:pipe (:a1 :a2) .

:n1 a :NOP .

:n2 a :NOP .

:n3 a :Merge ;
    :port :p1 ;
    :port :p2 .
