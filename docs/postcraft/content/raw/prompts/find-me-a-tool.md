I wish to convert PDF documents to markdown text as part of a toolchain running in node. I need an open source library. I can already convert HTML to markdown, so a library for doing PDF to HTML would be ok too. Can you please give me recommendations based on the following criteria :
1. minimal dependencies - ideally the libs will be entirely in javascript or typescript. If native libs are required, they must be available cross-platform
2. popularity
3. recent update
4. maturity
5. simplicity
6. versatility
