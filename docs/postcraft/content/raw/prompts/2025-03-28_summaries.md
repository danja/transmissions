Please summarise this request :
This is a simple documentation task. Think deeply but don't overthink and use up all your context window. The project in your project knowledge is designed so that it is possible to work in different areas at different levels of abstraction without filling the context window unnecessarily. There are the core components under src/engine, src/model and src/api that should only rarely need touching. At an application level, a transmission is a workflow defined primarily by a `transmissions.ttl` (and any associated config). The aim is that this level can be used most of the time. When new code is required it should be straightforward to create individual components in isolation, subclasses of Processor. What I would like you to do is to create a howto document corresponding to each primary dir under src that describes how to develop in that scope. It should contain only just as necessary for an agent to have all the information they need, and no more.  Please render these as individual artifacts worded in a way so an llm like claude can minimise unnecessary tokens.
