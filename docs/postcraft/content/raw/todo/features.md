# Transmissions ToDo : Features

* somehow make the processor type more visible in config/manifest

maybe just naming
```turtle
:p10Settings a :ConfigSet ;
...
```


* add a safety check to FileRemove

## Postcraft - related

set up the multi-transmission runner

move to trans-apps



## RDF

drop need for `:ConfigSettings`

allow settings in `transmissions.ttl`
(when it's loaded, use grapoi, prime config)
precedence?

## Processors

### `src/processors/semem`

* ``

### `src/processors/llms`
