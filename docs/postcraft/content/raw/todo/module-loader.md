The path to Processor.js could be loaded dynamically?

```Failed to load from /home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/test_module-load/processors: Cannot find module '/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/transmissions/src/processors/base/Processor.js' imported from /home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/test_module-load/processors/Concat.js
