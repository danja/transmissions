<p>Currently the code is set up around passing messages of the form process(data, context) where data is a string and context is a dictionary.
I wish to refactor the code under src such that the methods with a signature like this:</p>
<pre><code>execute(data, context)
enqueue(data, context)
messageQueue.push({ data, context })
</code></pre>
<p>are changed to this:</p>
<pre><code>execute(context)
enqueue(context)
messageQueue.push({ context })
</code></pre>
<p>to start I think it will be best to modify the code under src/applications to move the data argument into the context dictionary so: {data: data}
Can you advise how best to proceed methodically, step-by-step?</p>

The purpose of the code is to apply a processing pipeline to text. Services define the individual nodes which are instantiated by dependency injection. The connections between nodes will given declaratively using Connector.js. Here the code should read a file, apply a process to it and save it again.

<p>The following task should be approached by first making a list of small, incremental steps.
In the code, getService(serviceName) in di/ServiceContainer.js should delegate to the ServiceFactory class in di/ServiceFactory.js to create the services. Currently getService method in ServiceContainer.js is using the service name to create an instance via the ServiceFactory, but it&#39;s not passing any configuration data to the createService method of ServiceFactory. Please modify the getService method to pass the appropriate configuration to the ServiceFactory.</p>

<p>Please be silent apart from short status messages. I will upload an ES6 project as a zip file. The purpose of the code is to apply a processing pipeline to text. Services define the individual nodes which are instantiated by dependency injection.
Load the code into Deno and execute run.js
First carefully identify the cause of the errors through analysis. simplepipe.json is correct, so the problem must be in the code. When done, zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Be silent apart from short status messages.</p>
<p>and take note of the errors. Add logging messages to help identify the cause of the errors. Check the syntax as you go along.

Downloaded, thanks.
I would you to carry out a refactoring that will need a plan of small, incremental steps. It involves the Transmission class in di/Transmission.js, ServiceContainer class in di/ServiceContainer.js and SimplePipe in transmissions/SimplePipe.js The aim is to decouple the components and have the system constructed at run time based on a configuration file such as simplepipe.json
This will involve reimplementing the functionality of SimplePipe in a generic way that will be created at runtime.
The Transmission class will construct an abstract model of the topology derived from a json file such as simplepipe.json.
The ServiceContainer class will be responsible for creating the concrete services, creating the flow described in the Transmission and executing it.
Now create a list of small, incremental steps to carry out this refactoring.</p>
<p>Now work through the steps, be silent apart from short status messages. After code changes, zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.</p>

<p>Here is a Javascript file, t2j.js. Save it to /mnt/data/
The job is to implement the method convert(), which will take a string in Turtle RDF syntax and convert it to JSON-LD. The code will in ES6 format. This will be achieved by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>initiate Deno with the following libraries: readable-stream, @rdfjs/data-model, @rdfjs/serializer-turtle, @rdfjs/serializer-jsonld</li>
<li>run the current t2j.js to check the environment. If there are any errors, make the necessary adjustments to the environment so that it is working without errors.</li>
<li>Implement the convert() method in t2j.js</li>
<li>Save the latest version of t2j.js to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.</li>
