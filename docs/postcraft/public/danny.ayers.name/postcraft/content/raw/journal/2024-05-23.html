        <h1>Whelmed</h1>
<p>I typed that title yesterday, nothing else. <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/whelm\">Whelm</a> (<em>to cover or engulf</em>) is archaic, its <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/whelm\">etymology</a> is rather muddled, Germanic somehow. Here, I&#39;ll have it to contrast with <em>overwhelmed</em>, how I was earlier in the week. One of my many mental flaws is that I&#39;m prone to getting into that state. I know it&#39;ll be temporary, but it&#39;s not nice at the time. Nowadays it&#39;s nowhere as problematic for me as it used to be. I&#39;m much more aware of what brings it on : a particular kind of uncertainty/insecurity.
...</p>
<p>I like the sound of the word whelm, it sounds very underwhelming, like <em>whim</em>. There&#39;s a nice use of that in an episode of Blackadder - not immediately findable so here&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4IQjUpTNVU\">Baldrick&#39;s maths lesson</a> instead. (Coincidentally I&#39;m also hopeless at elementary arithmetic, but that&#39;s another story.)</p>
<h2>Plan</h2>
<p>syncthing - sorted - I&#39;d forgotten I had a VPN running on the phone...</p>
<p>Two main things today:</p>
<ol>
<li>#FOAFRetrospective stuff - didn&#39;t get started</li>
<li>No.7 cantina plumbing - done, as best I can</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a load of diverse things for 1. As a quick push-pin in the map, I&#39;ll pull in something danbri said the other day (it&#39;s the man himself that&#39;s motivated me to do this) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think for foaf collecting raw materials is key</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the most interesting or impactful things that ever used it</p>
<p>Or ongojng use in linkeddata datasets</p>
<p>Skos is also kind of needing the same but is probably another story
