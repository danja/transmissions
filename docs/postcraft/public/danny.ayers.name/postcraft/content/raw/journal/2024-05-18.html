<p><em>actually <strong>Journal : 2024-05-18</strong> but as this will be the first visible post, that title will do</em></p>
<p>Well, that was incredibly gruelling. But I&#39;ve now got a working static site generator, #Postcraft, and I&#39;m using it to generate this page. It&#39;s not pretty, but it&#39;s a start.</p>
<p>#Postcraft is only an <em>application</em> of something I&#39;m calling #Transmissions, a pipeliney thing to help me put together other (more interesting) systems. I&#39;ve spent ages on this thing, and raced the last mile to get this working end-to-end, leaving loads of dreadful hacky code in my wake. But it puts me in a good place from which to move forward. My immediate next step is just to sort out the TODOs in the codebase, so I can dip in to tidy up and know what I&#39;m doing. Meanwhile, I can start using it for some of that more interesting stuff, and blog about it!
