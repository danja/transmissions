        <h1>Do Stuff</h1>
<p>That&#39;s a note to self. <code>&lt;h1/&gt;</code>, broadcast. I&#39;m in danger of going down that rabbit hole of exploring how best to prioritize my TODOs. As a way of avoiding doing stuff. Stop.</p>
<p>Kitchen timer set for an hour. A job outside for a break then, and not before. Focus!</p>
<p>Ok, first thing I need to get out of the way is a working assistant. I haven&#39;t splashed out on ChatGPT4 this month and the 3.5 model winds me up, being almost useful, but not quite. <a href=\"https://groq.com/\">Groq</a> (with a &#39;q&#39;) is excellent good model-wise, <em>so fast</em>, but the path between a human and their models is a bit bendy. ChatGPT&#39;s interface is better, but still not quite there. I will have to bite the bullet soon and get one or more services tied into my workflow via API(s). But that <em>isn&#39;t high priority</em>. I&#39;ve bookmarked a bit of kit on GitHub that looked like it&#39;s usable in a ChatGPT fashion, but you get to choose your own endpoint.</p>
<p>First though, ChatGPT4o might be available by now... Ok, who knows, it appears the $20/m is needed to find out that way. So API time, through that GitHub thing.</p>

<p><em>&quot;We recommend using Docker Compose to install LibreChat&quot;</em>. Hmm. I&#39;m not a great fan of Docker, I generally prefer to have a car with the hood open venting steam in the yard than driving a rental. But the <code>npm</code> install has several dependencies, MongoDB and stuff. Let&#39;s have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/blob/main/package.json\">package.json</a>. Ok, not too scary. A lot of scripts wired in, interesting... But that could be a thief of time. I need to <strong>Do Stuff</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat.git

fatal: destination path &#39;LibreChat&#39; already exists and is not an empty directory.
</code></pre>
<p>Oops. No idea how long ago I did that. I might even have forked it. Dunno. I&#39;ll move that dir over and start again.</p>
<p><code>cp .env.example .env</code></p>
<p>Ok, what&#39;s in <a href=\"https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/blob/main/.env.example\">.env.example</a>?
Looks reasonably clear. Some slightly unnerving things that look like keys, but I&#39;m the client here so not to worry.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure <code>localhost:3080</code> is clear, <code>mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017</code> should be ok too. Even if that is MongoDB&#39;s default port, pretty sure it&#39;s not running on this machine.</p>
<pre><code>docker compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p>Some warnings about unset variables.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pulling <a href=\"https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/what_is_meilisearch/overview\">meilisearch</a> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a RESTful search API. It aims to be a ready-to-go solution for everyone who wants a fast and relevant search experience for their end-users</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve seen the name before, not investigated. Seems to be a pay-for service, but with open source bits. Annoyingly the <em>Overview</em> tells you everything except what it is. Yes, it&#39;s a search engine, which narrows it down to about 10,000 possibilities. One thing that is clear, it says <em>RESTful search API</em> so it has a HTTP interface</p>
