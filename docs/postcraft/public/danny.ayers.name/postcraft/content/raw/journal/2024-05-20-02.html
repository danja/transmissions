        <h1>This is not an Ecumenical Matter</h1>
<p>For context, I don&#39;t have much of a real-world social life compared my peers - I&#39;m borderline Boomer/Gen X. Those people that could do personal encounters, tendency to start dying nowadays. I&#39;m fine. In retrospect most of my motivation to engage with people, be a great party-goer, was driven by my genitals. That drive hasn&#39;t gone away, but desire for a quiet life has taken over.</p>
<p>Forget that. I have a besty, Marinella. Lives 5km away. Such a lovely person, I really landed on my feet meeting her.</p>
<p>Mari has a friend Sean staying for a couple of days. A guy she met in Rome years back. (I&#39;m terrible with datetime things. Fairly sure I&#39;m 60, Mari a decade older, Sean a decade older than that).</p>
<p>Sean is Irish, studied Missiology (the branch of theology to do with missions, comfortably named) in Rome, the epicentre of bonkers mythology.</p>
<p>Mari herself would be unusual anywhere, rural hills of Toscana, wtf. Like, when you meet her, it won&#39;t take long for you to realise that she&#39;s well-educated (was a gyn/obs surgeon), very clever. But her superpower is she&#39;s kind. After technically retiring, she went to (insert country) Africa to help out in a hospital.</p>
<p>I think she is brilliant herself. But she knows so many brilliant people. Is weird. (Although I do something similar myself - learn stuff, seek out the people who are best at things).</p>
<p>Back to Sean, her house guest for a couple of days. I didn&#39;t want to impinge, but I had to say hello at some point.</p>
<p>I&#39;m from a village in northern England. Prejudices. I did get to know plenty of Irish people in Sheffield (not true - Bernadette spoke for all Ireland, I think she was born in Sheffield), I <em>did</em> get to know plenty of Irish people in London.
But I still had the stereotype of an old Irish priest though.
Mostly Father Ted, bless his soul. Or Church ordained kiddy-fucker, not bless.</p>
<p>This Sean, worked as a priest <em>some</em> of his adult life. Lived in the Philipines for a while, then a lot of time in China - on paper teaching English (not a priest not a priest), helping Chinese postgrads to make their papers work in English.
Incredible guy. Absolute consumer of information - ok, that is a trait some people have, remember bus routes, but...
Maybe he would be diagnosed with autism or something if he saw a shrink, in his 80s. As we started chatting, talked about cars. Encyclopedic knowledge (I know absolutely nothing about cars). Travel things, Boieng engineering issues and how they&#39;d screwed up. We ended up on the geopolitical situation, at Mari&#39;s kitchen table. The guy is brilliant. Devours everything, which I&#39;ve seen plenty of humans do, but then he&#39;s analysed at a very careful level. I&#39;ve never seen such broadness brought together, totally consistently.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve left the best one until last, which happened first.</p>
<p>Literally the next thing he said after intros was that he wanted to sort out Mari&#39;s tired old computer (Yeah, I&#39;ve tried). He said &quot;I have 7 or 8 Linux distros on a stick here&quot;.
Yeah. That. Ancient Irish fecking priest.
Mint.
