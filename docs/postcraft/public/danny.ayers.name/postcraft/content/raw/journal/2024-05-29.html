        <h1>Calm</h1>
<p>I woke up calm and rested after a good night&#39;s sleep. Had about an hour doing odds &amp; end. All good. Then a video call from my mother, generally all ok but she promptly stressed me out. Headache, and the <em>No.7 insurance</em> thing has changed in my head from being a straightforward process to a <em>Big Difficult Thing</em> (nothing has changed in reality).</p>
<p>I needed to get data from the old server so I could kill it off before the end of the month (so as not to pay for it again). Done.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have something in place as a default AI assistant for <em>all the things</em>. I was using ChatGPT4, but hadn&#39;t subscribed for a couple of months ($ flow). <a href=\"https://groq.com/\">Groq</a> was a very good stand-in, but their free offerings didn&#39;t seem any use for managing per-task/project conversations. I started setting up <a href=\"https://www.librechat.ai/\">LibreChat</a> the other day, the plan being to to use it as a front end to <em>whatever</em>.</p>
<p>So many distractions, and I wanted to try out ChatGPT4o anyway, so I signed up there again.</p>
<p>Just now I had another quick look at #LibreChat - the Docker-based local install had worked nicely, I just had to add my API key for OpenAI to get that working.</p>
<p>Might as well have that starting on boot on this machine. With a little help from GitHub #Copilot (I have a sub there) I got a systemd service file set up.</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=LibreChat
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/danny/AI/LibreChat
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-compose up
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker-compose down
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm. It didn&#39;t work. Copilot to the rescue :</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable librechat
</code></pre>
<p>Further probs. I did a load of updating things, still no joy. Then I wondered about a flag Copilot had given me : <code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-compose up -d</code>. That appears to have worked! Educated guesswork that should have started sooner with distrusting AI.</p>

<h3>FOAF Retrospective</h3>
<p>danbri&#39;s last message about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think for foaf collecting raw materials is key
Like the most interesting or impactful things that ever used it
Or ongojng use in linkeddata datasets
Skos is also kind of needing the same but is probably another story
 </p>
