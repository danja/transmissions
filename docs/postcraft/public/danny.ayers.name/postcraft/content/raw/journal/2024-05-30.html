        <h1>Good Things Come in Threes</h1>
<p>I had to be up unnaturally early (for me) this morning, Mari giving me a lift for a blood test. So I didn&#39;t have a coffee until after. Wouldn&#39;t usually have been a good start to the day, but the clean-enough jeans I found to wear had â‚¬30 in the pocket. No idea when from.
Then when she dropped me back I noticed some new flowers on the balcony (photo here if I get around to it). Two good things.
I totally reject the stupid supernatural nonsense about bad things coming in threes, but today I&#39;m open to the notion of a third good thing. Even a 4th or 5th. Bring it on.</p>
<p>So many distractions, my head is a bit scrambled. But fortunately it&#39;s pretty clear what the next few things I need to do are, and all <em>should</em> be straightforward, procedural.</p>
<h2>Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Server rebuild bits</p>
</li>
<li><p>#FOAFRetrospective stuff</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bookmark store</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write about aligning projects</p>
</li>
<li><p>No.7 stuff</p>
</li>
<li><p>#Groq on #LibreChat</p>
</li>
<li><p>Family email</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ve been procrastinating about server admin because I had the tedious job of decommissioning the old server to do before anything else. But that&#39;s now done I can look forward. 1-3 above are very intertwingled, and 4. is about jotting down thoughts on how best to manage tasks when there are common demands across projects. 5. is actually highest priority, but I&#39;ll be better able to deal with those things after a bit of dopamine from 1-4.</p>
<p>A meta-project in all this is facilitating the capture of any useful information. This blog setup was must-have numero uno, a consistent place to capture notes, under my control, with maximal potential for reuse. The next thing I need is a place to store links. I&#39;ve been here before, several times. It seems a no-brainer to use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL\">SPARQL</a> store.</p>
<p>Oops, I forgot 6. That shouldn&#39;t take long, worth getting out of the way, it will hopefully help with the other things.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got LibreChat running locally with Docker Compose, it&#39;s connecting to OpenAI&#39;s GPT4o API fine. But that was ready to go out of the box (just add an API key). Groq appears in LibreChat&#39;s list of potential services, but isn&#39;t yet showing up in the UI.</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly what I don&#39;t like about Docker!</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I can&#39;t contradict any of the very strong arguments in favour of using containers and suchlike. But there&#39;s no denying it&#39;s adding an additional component to the stack/system/process. I&#39;m inexperienced with it - for example, right now I&#39;m not clear about where and when LibreChat&#39;s config &amp; build files are consumed. There&#39;s a <code>.env</code> and a
