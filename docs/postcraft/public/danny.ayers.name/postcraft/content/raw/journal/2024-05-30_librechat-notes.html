        <h1>LibreChat Notes 2024-05-30</h1>
<p><a href=\"https://www.librechat.ai/\">LibreChat</a> is a front end for conversational AI services. It&#39;s design is not dissimilar to OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT Web interface, but supports a wide range of services. It&#39;s open source, and can be run locally or wherever. They recommend using Docker, which is what I did. I&#39;m on Ubuntu here, they support all the usual desktop platforms.</p>
<p><strong>LibreChat is in active development, flux likely, so note the date above.</strong></p>
<p>For starters I wanted to use models from <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-api/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://groq.com/\">Groq</a>. API keys are needed - OpenAI&#39;s is pay-as-you-go, Groq is free but capped usage (and very fast).</p>
<p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.librechat.ai/docs/local/docker\">Local Installation of LibreChat with Docker</a> will get the thing up and basically running with no fuss. But out of the box there are a few things that might not be immediately obvious.</p>
<p>For the OpenAI API key, first copy yours to clipboard then click the dropdown labeled <strong>OpenAI</strong> top-left of screen and click the gear icon to the right of OpenAI on the list. That&#39;s it <strong>done</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>Groq</strong> it&#39;s a little more involved.</p>
<p>I was going around in circles for quite a while until I saw that the instructions for <a href=\"https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/setup\">YAML Setup</a> appear <em>after</em> those for <a href=\"https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/ai_endpoints\">Custom AI Endpoints</a>. The former tells you a <code>docker-compose.override.yml</code> is needed (a new one from the code on that page worked for me). That points Docker to a <code>librechat.yaml</code> file.
Conveniently (for me) their <code>librechat.example.yaml</code> file has an entry for Groq, so I just copied &amp; renamed the whole file to <code>librechat.yaml</code>. It contains:</p>
<pre><code>  custom:
    # Groq Example
    - name: &#39;groq&#39;
      apiKey: &#39;${GROQ_API_KEY}&#39;
      baseURL: &#39;https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/&#39;
      ...
</code></pre>
<p><em>However</em>, I&#39;m no doubt missing something here, but it didn&#39;t pick up my environment variable set with:</p>
<pre><code>export GROQ_API_KEY=...
</code></pre>
<p>Probably not best practices, but this is on a local install, so I simply pasted my key instead of the <code>${GROQ_API_KEY}</code> bit above.
<strong>It works!!!</strong></p>
<p>I intend using this quite a lot, so I created a service file for systemd,</p>
<p>in <code>/etc/systemd/system/librechat.service</code> :</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=LibreChat
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/danny/AI/LibreChat
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-compose up
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker-compose down
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>
<p><em>Adjust paths to taste</em></p>
<p>I always get confused about the order of these, it&#39;s something like:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable librechat
sudo systemctl start librechat
</code></pre>
<p>If you run into probs, try all the usual update procedures for Docker, npm, etc. before tearing your hair out.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be trying some other services soon (I see they have support for Ollama, so that&#39;s definitely in my queue). If there&#39;s anything useful to share I&#39;ll add it here.
