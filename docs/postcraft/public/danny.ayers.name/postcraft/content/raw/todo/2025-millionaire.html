        <h1>TODO in 2025, become a millionaire</h1>
<p>Don&#39;t laugh, this is serious!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll write it up better later, but a dated marker was needed.</p>
<p>This occurred to me the other day.</p>
<p>Many &quot;normal&quot; motivations don&#39;t work for me, my bag of #:adhd. On a rational level I know I (urgently) need to make some money to pay the bills (and avoid ending up with court action from Gaia, the water suppliers). &quot;Get some paid work&quot; - yeah, <strong>I know</strong> (and at this point in time, my previously-niche skillset makes me eminently employable). But there is a gap between knowing and action. For me it doesn&#39;t work like that.</p>
<p>But <strong><em>reframed</em></strong>, I can trick myself. &quot;Make €1m in 2025&quot; as a goal, yeah, course I can do that.</p>
<p>The actuality of the €1m itself remains to be seen, but the actually of the <em>actions</em> needed to get there have already begun. And might just keep me out of debtor&#39;s gaol.
