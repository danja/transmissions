<p>Some say the music industry is dead then make YouTube videos for musicians telling them how to win in a dead industry.  Fact:  the music industry is a multi billion dollar business.  It has reset but not to the advantage of musicians.  Not surprising because it was always like that.<br>It is very important if you commit your life to a career as a music artist, that is a writer, composer or performer to pick a competent trustworthy management team.  A mistake here is ruinous as in, it will destroy your chance of having long term success whatever or however promising the short term wins.<br>How do you make that choice count?  Ideas?</p>
<h3>Don &#39;Bigd&#39; Swensen :</h3>
<p>&quot;The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs&quot; - Hunter S Thompson</p>
<h3>Phil Valenti :</h3>
<p>Start your own music publishing company. Own everything you write.
Get a young manager. A beginner that needs your success.
If youâ€™re a performer be prepared to tour.</p>
<h3>Me :</h3>
<p>I very much like Phil&#39;s suggestions.</p>
<p>To which I&#39;d add: document and publish your progress in every available medium. Share links on all social platforms.</p>
<p>Firstly, this gives you some immediate exposure. Blogging is great for maintaining a single source of (your own) truth, noting your thoughts and jotting down useful links etc. Over time it can act both as a reference and give you a sense of progress.</p>
<p>Music platforms like SoundCloud incline you towards home recording, any experience with that is useful (and money-saving).</p>
<p>YouTube skills are a must-have these days for anyone wanting to do public-facing creativity. End-product music videos are an obvious target, but I reckon things like autobiographical, tutorial material and any random stuff that crosses your mind are worth doing too.</p>
<p>I&#39;d strongly recommend a publish and be damned attitude. By which I mostly mean, don&#39;t feel insecure about putting stuff out that isn&#39;t to the standard to which you aspire. The act of publishing/broadcasting <em>anything</em> in itself will boost your confidence (NB. remember even negative comments are engagement, which is positive).</p>
<p>It is bound to be dreadfully slow at first, but you will also be accumulating an audience and useful contacts along the way.</p>
<p>If further down the road you decide to hide the content you&#39;re not satisfied with, you have that option. But I reckon having a trail behind will make you more interesting to people, help you stand out. An individual story is appealing to everyone.<br>...
PS. Frame your own narrative.
