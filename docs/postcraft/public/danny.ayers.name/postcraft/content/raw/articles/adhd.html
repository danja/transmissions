        <h1>ADHD</h1>
<p><strong>THESE ARE ROUGH NOTES WAITING FOR ME TO DO A PROPER WRITEUP</strong></p>
<p>Before continuing, there a few things <em>everyone</em> should know about ADHD :</p>
<ul>
<li>It is real (see below)</li>
<li>It is not an illness or disability in itself</li>
<li>What most people think they know about it, including a lot of medical professionals, is just plain <strong>wrong</strong> (in no small part due to the acronym being misleading)</li>
<li>It affects different people in different ways</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Bits</h2>
<p>A thing I have right now that is entertainingly neuro-atypical, a streak on Duolingo.</p>
<p>I had two years of French &amp; German at secondary school (13-14 yrs old?) where I didn&#39;t learn anything. Out of the 4 times I was caned (hit hard with a stick on the backside) at that school, 2 were for not doing French homework. I didn&#39;t see the point at the time.
Since, I&#39;ve found myself pretty hopeless at learning languages. I&#39;ve lived in Italy for about 25 years, my Italian is shite.</p>
<p>But the other day I was set up for a blindish date with a Japanese woman (not remotely a match as it happened), thought I&#39;d at least learn enough to be polite. Duolingo.
I found it really satisfying. So it immediately became my new thing.</p>
<p>I&#39;m on my 9th day of doing a lesson a day of Japanese, Italian, French, German, Spanish &amp; Arabic. When I need a flop on the couch, alternative to doomscrolling. Only takes about 30 mins. According to Duolingo I&#39;m making good progress.</p>
<p>I had my ~quarterly visit to my psychiatrist this morning. Told her about this. &quot;You couldn&#39;t do that, unless you were a genius&quot;. Well that&#39;s where you are wrong. I have <em>at best</em> average intelligence. But certain things in certain conditions , I can excel at<sup><a id=\"footnote-ref-ducks\" href=\"#footnote-ducks\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup>.
For whatever reason I&#39;m engaged with Duolingo. It&#39;s given me a little surprise about my cognitives. I am slow-witted (ameliorated by compensation mechanisms), but I&#39;m ok at switching context. I&#39;ve literally only once been hit by the language changes, I nearly spelled &#39;aeroporto&#39; as &#39;aeropuerto&#39; (but even then I caught myself in time).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not figured it out yet, but the teaching approach done by the Duolingo app does appear to fit my brain wiring (fast dopamine?). I might actually learn something.</p>
<p>But I&#39;d better do it quick, almost certainly I&#39;ll drift off from it in a week or two, like it never happened. Like my catapult (slingshot) or lock-picking fads. Except these things don&#39;t go away. Way more than a year after I last played with a catapult, but it crossed my mind again the other day, I&#39;ve bought some fresh rubber bands from the Chinese shop.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how common this trait is amongst people that tick the neurodivergent boxes, but despite the flitty attention, I generally come back to things, it&#39;s a very serious persistence over very extended time periods. I&#39;m still working on many things I started when I was 10, 20, 30... Very gappy and shuffled. Booted about a bit by new things that attach. Parasitic memes maybe, facehuggers that spring out when you are busy doing something else. I&#39;m still building the same synth I started in the attic at Blackwell around 1975. Memory can be a pain though, steps do get retraced too often. I&#39;ll have to remind myself of how to tie constrictor knots again, to attach the rubber bands (and make that rope ladder useful). How to fall off a bicycle.</p>
<p>Time Blindness</p>
<p><em>I intend to do a proper write-up of this sometime soon FOOTNOTE. But due to my mother&#39;s ill health I&#39;m likely to have to spend some time in the UK in the near future, with interactions with people that don&#39;t know me that well, so I&#39;ll get key points down now to save wasting everyone&#39;s time on in-person explanations.</em></p>
<p>I FN was recently formally diagnosed with adult ADHD. It explains <em>a lot</em>. My life has been strongly impacted by traits that were generally put down to personality (even by me). In the past I have been diagnosed with well-known mental health conditions : anxiety (major), depression (minor) and alcoholism (chronic). Several times I&#39;ve tried various standard treatments to alleviate these, without significant results. In recent years, more through luck than judgement, through a combination of environmental changes LINK and largely informal help, the negative effects have been reduced. It&#39;s become increasingly apparent that the primary root cause of these problems was the ADHD. The bad bits are common comorbidities.</p>
