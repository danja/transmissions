<p>== Biology ==
&#39;&#39;S. boulardii&#39;&#39; was characterized as a species separate from &#39;&#39;S. cerevisiae&#39;&#39; because it does not digest [[galactose]] and does not undergo sporulation. It also tolerates human body temperature, gastric acid, and digestive enzymes better. Despite all these [[phenotypic]] differences, its genomic sequence defines it as a clade under &#39;&#39;S. cerevisiae&#39;&#39;, closest to those found in wine. Like ordinary &#39;&#39;S. cerevisiae&#39;&#39;, it has 16 chromosomes, a 2-micron circle plasmid, and is diploid with genes for both mating types, [[mating of yeast|MATa and MATα]]. However, the MATa locus contains some likely disabling mutations relative to spore-forming &#39;&#39;S. cerevisiae&#39;&#39;.<ref name=genome/></p>
<p>Both &#39;&#39;S. boulardii&#39;&#39; and ordinary &#39;&#39;S. cerevisiae&#39;&#39; produce proteins that inhibit pathogenic bacteria and their toxins, specifically 63-kDa phosphatase &#39;&#39;pho8&#39;&#39; (inhibiting &#39;&#39;E. coli&#39;&#39; [[endotoxin]]) and 54-kDa serine protease &#39;&#39;ysp3&#39;&#39; (hydrolyzing [[Clostridium difficile toxin A|&#39;&#39;C. difficile&#39;&#39; toxins A]] and [[Clostridium difficile toxin B|B]]). A yet-unidentified 120 [[kDa]] protein also inhibits changes in cAMP levels induced by [[cholera toxin]]. &#39;&#39;S. boulardii&#39;&#39; encodes extra copies of yeast adhesion proteins called [[yeast flocculation|flocculin]]s that help to stick to pathogenic bacteria and stop them from binding to the intestinal mucus.<ref name=genome/>{{rp|at=supp. text}}</p>

A position paper published by ESPGHAN Working Group for Probiotics and Prebiotics based on a systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials  suggested that &#39;&#39;S. boulardii&#39;&#39; (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation) may be considered in the management of children with acute gastroenteritis in addition to rehydration therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Szajewska H, Guarino A, Hojsak I, Indrio F, Kolacek S, Shamir R, Vandenplas Y, Weizman Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Use of probiotics for management of acute gastroenteritis: a position paper by the ESPGHAN Working Group for Probiotics and Prebiotics | journal = Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 531–539 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24614141 | doi = 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000320 | s2cid = 1989479 | doi-access = free }}</ref></p>

<p>=== Food and drinks ===
&#39;&#39;S. c.&#39;&#39; var. &#39;&#39;boulardii&#39;&#39; is usable in [[beer brewing]], with live yeast remaining in the finished product. It can coexist alongside other &#39;&#39;S. cerevisiae&#39;&#39; in mixed starter cultures.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Capece A, Romaniello R, Pietrafesa A, Siesto G, Pietrafesa R, Zambuto M, Romano P | title = Use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii in co-fermentations with S. cerevisiae for the production of craft beers with potential healthy value-added | journal = International Journal of Food Microbiology | volume = 284 | pages = 22–30 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 29990636 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.06.028 | s2cid = 51615634 }}</ref></p>
<p>It can be also used for [[baking]], where its ability to deter bacteria translates into inhibition of [[rope spoilage]], a bread defect caused by &#39;&#39;[[Bacillus subtilis]]&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;[[Bacillus licheniformis|B. licheniformis]]&#39;&#39; contamination.<ref>{{cite web |author1=ITMO University |title=Food Science: Baking Self-Healing Bread and Brewing Probiotic Beer |url=<a href=\"https://scitechdaily.com/food-science-baking-self-healing-bread-and-brewing-probiotic-beer/\">https://scitechdaily.com/food-science-baking-self-healing-bread-and-brewing-probiotic-beer/</a> |website=SciTechDaily |date=27 June 2020 |access-date=6 February 2022 |archive-date=6 February 2022 |archive-url=<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220206141920/https://scitechdaily.com/food-science-baking-self-healing-bread-and-brewing-probiotic-beer/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20220206141920/https://scitechdaily.com/food-science-baking-self-healing-bread-and-brewing-probiotic-beer/</a> |url-status=live }}</ref></p>
