<p>&#39;&#39;&#39;Tibicos&#39;&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;&#39;water kefir&#39;&#39;&#39;, is a traditional [[fermented drink]] made with water and a water kefir grains held in a [[polysaccharide]] [[biofilm]] [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] created by the bacteria.
It is sometimes consumed as an alternative to milk-based [[probiotic]] drinks or tea-cultured products such as [[kombucha]]. Water kefir is typically made as a probiotic [[Homebrewing|homebrew]] beverage. The finished product, if bottled, will produce a carbonated beverage.</p>
<p>==Cultures==
Tibicos cultures are found around the world, with no two being exactly the same; but typical tibicos have a mix of &#39;&#39;[[Lactobacillus]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Streptococcus]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Pediococcus]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Leuconostoc]]&#39;&#39; bacteria, with yeasts from &#39;&#39;[[Saccharomyces]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Kloeckera]]&#39;&#39; and possibly others. &#39;&#39;[[Lactobacillus brevis]]&#39;&#39; bacteria has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the [[dextran]] [[polysaccharide]] that forms the &quot;grains&quot;.<ref name=\"Moinas\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Horisberger | first1 = M. | last2 = Bauer | first2 = H. | last3 = Bauer | first3 = Heinz| title = The structural organization of the Tibi grain as revealed by light, scanning and transmission microscopy | journal = Archives of Microbiology |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=157–161 |date=December 1980 |doi=10.1007/BF00406153 | bibcode = 1980ArMic.128..157M | s2cid = 30407268 }}</ref><ref name=\"Pidoux\">{{Cite journal | title = The microbial flora of sugary kefir grain (the gingerbeer plant): biosynthesis of the grain from &#39;&#39;Lactobacillus hilgardii&#39;&#39; producing a polysaccharide gel | journal = World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology|volume=5 |pages=223–38 |date=June 1989 |doi=10.1007/BF01741847 | issue = 2 | last1 = Pidoux | first1 = M. | s2cid = 83381986}}</ref></p>
<p>As with [[kefir|milk kefir]] &quot;grains&quot;, the [[microbes]] present in tibicos act in [[symbiosis]] to maintain a stable culture. Tibicos can do this in many different sugary liquids like coconut water, fruit juice or sugar mixed with water, feeding off the sugar to produce [[lactic acid]], alcohol ([[ethanol]]), and [[carbon dioxide]] gas, which [[Carbonation|carbonates]] the drink.</p>

<p>== Preparation ==
{{sources needed|section|date=September 2020}}
[[Image:Kefir wodny (Tibicos).jpg|thumb|250px|Tibicos colony under microscope (200×)|alt=]]
The basic preparation method is for tibicos to be added to a sugary liquid and [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] 24 to 48 hours. The water is kept at a room temperature range of {{convert|20-30|C|F|round=5}}. If the temperature is towards the upper end of this range, the fermentation period is shortened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=<a href=\"https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/water-kefir/encouraging-water-kefir-grains-to-multiply/%7Ctitle\">https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/water-kefir/encouraging-water-kefir-grains-to-multiply/|title</a> = Encouraging Water Kefir Grains to Multiply: 7 Tips for Happy &amp; Healthy Grains| date=23 June 2022 }}</ref> A typical recipe might contain the tibicos culture, a citrus fruit, dried fruit, and water.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gross |first1=Ivo |title=The ultimate guide to water kefir |url=<a href=\"https://letsgotomato.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-water-kefir/\">https://letsgotomato.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-water-kefir/</a> |website=Letsgotomato.com |date=11 July 2023 |access-date=6 September 2023}}</ref></p>
<!--  not a cookbook * 1/4 to 1/2 cup of tibicos
* 1 dried [[ficus|fig]], halved
* 1/2 [[lemon]]
* 60&nbsp;grams or 4 tablespoons of [[white sugar]]
* 1 litre (4 cups) of water
* 2 litre jar with lid

Method: dissolve the sugar in the water, add the juice of the lemon, the lemon half, and the fig. After mixing, drop in the tibicos and cover the jar. If the lid is on tightly, you get a [[carbonated]] drink; if loose, a still drink. Use caution when creating carbonated beverages in glass containers, as these can overcarbonate if left too long, resulting in bottle grenades. Carbonating at least one of your bottles in a plastic bottle will all you to safely judge when the bottles have carbonated fully and are ready to drink. Set the jar aside to ferment at [[room temperature]] for 24 to 48 hours. When finished, strain out the tibicos to add to the next batch.
-->
<p>Some ingredients will inhibit fermentation, such as [[chlorine]] in tap water or preservatives in dried fruit (sulfites). The fruits used are changed and mixed to create different flavors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=<a href=\"https://fermentaholics.com/how-to-brew-water-kefir-at-home/%7Ctitle\">https://fermentaholics.com/how-to-brew-water-kefir-at-home/|title</a> = How to Brew Water Kefir: Your #1 Guide to DIY Water Kefir|date = 8 February 2021}}</ref></p>
<p>Additional precautions are taken to keep the cultures healthy. The use of reactive metals such as aluminium, copper, or zinc are minimised. The acidity of the solution will react with the metals forming metal ions, which could be potentially damaging to the culture. Instead, plastic, lead-free ceramic, or glass containers are commonly used. It is recommended to culture grains in a glass jar and use clean plastic or silicone utensils when handling the grains.</p>
<!-- For consideration,

Typical preparation:
 1 liter of water
80 grams of sugar
10 grams of dried fruit (prunes, apples, etc)
100 grams of hydrated tibicos

<p>Researchers demonstrated antimicrobial activity during tibicos fermentation, using tibicos grains to ferment different sugar sources, namely, molasses, demerara sugar, and brown sugar. Brown sugar promoted the greatest antimicrobial activities, against the microorganisms &#39;&#39;[[Candida albicans]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Salmonella typhi]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Shigella sonnei]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Staphylococcus aureus]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Escherichia coli]]&#39;&#39;.<ref name=\"Silva\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = Karoline | last2 = Rodrigues | first2 = Sheila | last3 = Filho | first3 = Lauro Xavier | last4 = Lima | first4 = Alvaro S. | title = Antimicrobial Activity of Broth Fermented with Kefir Grains | journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology |volume=152 |pages=316–325 |date=29 July 2008 | issue = 2 |doi=10.1007/s12010-008-8303-3| pmid = 18663417 | s2cid = 19989453 }}</ref></p>
