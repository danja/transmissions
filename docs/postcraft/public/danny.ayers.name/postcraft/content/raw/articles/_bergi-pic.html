<p>I&#39;ve been getting some (remarkably) nice comments about my new profile pic, so here&#39;s Bergi van Bergos&#39;s original from which it was cropped, taken spontaneously in a hotel bar (after fsw2011) in Berlin last year.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#39;d forgotten about this one. Gives me so much joy. I didn&#39;t say enough about the circumstances 12 years ago.
It might well have been the first time I met Bavarian Bergi, Thomas Bergwinkle, in person. We were staying in the same hotel, so after the conf* we had a beer in the bar. He&#39;d got a nice camera with him. As well as being another semweb devotee (a bloody good coder), he&#39;s also a photographer (and filmmaker, etc etc). Mentioned that he did band photos. Ooh ooh ooh - please please please take a Pop Star photo of me!! Literally a couple of minutes later he&#39;d got this. Absolutely perfect.</p>

<li>Federated Social Web Europe Conference 2011. It drew a <em>lot</em> of the movers &amp; shakers of the period, many familiar names/faces. Not sure what drew me to it - I think it was a case of intuitive &quot;must-go&quot;. Also - Berlin!
Everyone saw the way the wind was blowing with centralized silo socials, several presented &quot;Facebook Killer&quot; apps. I don&#39;t think any of which went anywhere. But there were also a good few bits of tech innovation around the federated/open space, I believe most of those have stood the test of time, now part of the background.</li>
