        <h1>CV bits for Leonardo</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I studied Electronics (for the music industry) and later Engineering IT.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I worked on support at a college for 7 years. End-user and network, we were very understaffed so I had to do a bit of everything. My boss, who was meant to look after the system was also in charge of the IT for management and finances, so I ended up doing most of the sysadmin. This was a long time ago : half the network ran Netware when I left, one job I was setting up email accounts for the staff. In most cases, their first.</p>
<p>But I did start learning about the Internet.</p>
<p>Linux</p>
<p>Hosts</p>
<h2>What I can do</h2>
<p>It&#39;s hit &amp; miss, self-taught things necessary to support my devops.</p>
<p>Linux admin
Electronics troubleshooting</p>
<h2>What I can&#39;t do</h2>
