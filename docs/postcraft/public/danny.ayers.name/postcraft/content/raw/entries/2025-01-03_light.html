<p>Chatted with ClaudioB earlier. He&#39;s planning to set up a machine at home to serve online. I started having a go a few weeks back but got distracted. Setting up #:semem in #:tbox and making it live is my main target today, but as that&#39;ll involve poking around on my remote server I might as well have another look then.</p>
<h2>Packer</h2>
<p>Before any of that, I need to finish a little #:transmission I started last session. repomix has broken on me. As best I can determine, it&#39;s down to nodejs version, looks like repomix uses some experimental JSON bits that have been pulled. If that is the case, I could use <em>that thing (?)</em> to choose a version that does work. <strong>Faff.</strong> I&#39;ve been meaning to make my own on #:transmissions for a while, this tipped me over. Claude gave me some starter code, I just need to <strong>plumb it in and tweak it to sanity, as per Claude code</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">transmissions$ ./trans packer ./
...
[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open &#39;/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/manifest.ttl&#39;]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Bum!</strong> I didn&#39;t get around to sorting out the command-line options.</p>
<p><strong>Good-o!</strong> I did start sorting out the command-line options.</p>
<p>Yeah, it looks reasonably well separated. The CLI entry point <code>./trans</code> calls <code>src/api/cli/run.js</code> which uses <a href=\"https://yargs.js.org/\">yargs</a> - <em>tee hee</em>, they say it best :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yargs be a node.js library fer hearties tryin&#39; ter parse optstrings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>src/api/cli/run.js</code> then calls <code>src/api/common/CommandUtils.js</code>. That does a little bit of path-splitting and simple logic, calling on <code>src/core/ApplicationManager.js</code> to get things going.</p>
<p>I remember now - I left a bit of refactoring around <code>src/core/ApplicationManager.js</code> in-progress. That&#39;s still not a high priority, I&#39;ll get to it when I next need to do things around there.</p>
<p>Hmm. The options do look very broken. But shouldn&#39;t take much fixing.</p>
<p>Well, you learn something every day. I wanted to check what was considered best practice for <strong>privates</strong> in JS. I asked Claude, confirmed with <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a> :</p>
<h3>Private Fields in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Private fields, denoted by the # prefix, were introduced as part of the ECMAScript 2022 (ES13) specification. This feature provides true privacy encapsulation within classes, preventing access to these fields from outside the class</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">class Person {
  #secret;
  constructor(secret) {
    this.#secret = secret;
  }
  getSecret() {
    return this.#secret;
  }
}

const person = new Person(&quot;my secret&quot;);
console.log(person.getSecret()); // &quot;my secret&quot;
console.log(person.#secret); // SyntaxError: Private field &#39;#secret&#39; must be declared in an enclosing class
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Supported in:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js 12.0.0+</li>
<li>Chrome 74+</li>
<li>Firefox 90+</li>
<li>Safari 14.1+</li>
<li>Edge 79+</li>
</ul>
<h3>Closures for Encapsulation</h3>
<p>Closures have been a traditional way to achieve encapsulation in JavaScript before the introduction of private class fields</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: function() {
      count++;
      console.log(count);
    }
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment(); // 1
console.log(counter.count); // undefined
</code></pre>
<p>Heh, not sure I&#39;ve ever used that kind of closure in JS. I can easily imagine my confusion over that syntax. I wouldn&#39;t call the private field <strong>#</strong> syntax pretty, but it&#39;s a lot more suitable for this <strong>bear of very little brain</strong>.
