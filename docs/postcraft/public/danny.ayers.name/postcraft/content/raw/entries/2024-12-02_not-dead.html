        <h1>Not Dead</h1>
<p><em>Title has a grim angle and a funny angle. Grim : it sounds like my mother is probably on her way out. My cousin estimates days not weeks, but he has a tendency to think the worst. I&#39;m trying to get more information to find out whether or not I need to fly over (the logistics are difficult, and last time I made the mistake of being too hasty). Funny : Just now on daily dogwalk #1, as we were going up the lane towards the cemetery, it looked like there was someone collapsed in the field just below. As I got closer - yes, definitely a person...small movement... I would have quickened my pace but Claudio already had me at top (not-fall-over) speed. Then I got close enough to see it was a man lying on his side on the ground, with a water drain cover open and him peering inside. Phew!</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a <em>lot</em> of integration &amp; suchlike jobs to do. But pausing that I&#39;m going to do a quick spike of #:squirt.
