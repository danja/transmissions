        <h1>Mindset</h1>
<p><em>To <strong>Get Things Done</strong> I have to trick myself to change mindset.</em></p>
<p>I wasted a lot of time in the last couple of weeks through not having decent tests in place. Easy explanation : it&#39;s a lot more fun developing new stuff than ensuring existing stuff works correctly. My subconscious says these are just my toys, I don&#39;t have to waste time on taking them seriously. But this is really counter-productive. I end up wasting time hunting down stupid mistakes and/or sorting out things I&#39;ve just let ride until a time it&#39;s much harder to figure out. I wouldn&#39;t do this if I was working on code for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Aim for releases.</strong></p>
