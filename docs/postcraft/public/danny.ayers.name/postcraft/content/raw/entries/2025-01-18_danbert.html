<p><em>I just saw a piece of paper I&#39;d written that on. No idea why.</em></p>
<p>Before getting out of bed this morning I did a bit of vocab work for #:kia with Claude. I got to desk and started trying to sort out #:semem with Claude - turning first-pass material into running code. I&#39;d only just started when the tokens ran out. Grr!
So I moved on to :</p>
<h2>Postcraft</h2>
<p>#:postcraft is a static site renderer built as a #:transmissions application (it renders this blog). About a week ago I broke the version I had been using. Not surprising, it was incredibly hacky, just a placeholder until I&#39;d figured out #:transmissions a bit more.</p>
<p>As I started rewriting that it made sense to make some of the changes to #:transmissions I&#39;ve had on the list for a while. Mostly simplifications, like flattening all the new RDF terms I was using into a single namespace.</p>
<p>The site rendering does this :</p>
<ol>
<li>walk a given dir containing markdown files</li>
<li>render each file into a minimal html content block</li>
<li>template each content block into a complete HTML page</li>
<li>gather the 5 most recent content blocks</li>
<li>template those 5 blocks into a front page (and an Atom feed)</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>DirWalker</code> process does <strong>1.</strong>, emitting a message for each file it encounters.</p>
<p>The old version had a lot of app-specific processors, totally at odds with the intended philosophy of small reusable processors. At <strong>2.</strong>, for each file it stuffed the raw HTML into files under <code>cache</code>, then continued, saving the page HTML in its target dir. <strong>4.</strong> was a horrid hack, somehow involving <code>DirWalker</code> accumulating the filenames in the message (I couldn&#39;t figure quite how I&#39;d done it). <strong>5.</strong> was a clunky script.</p>
<p>Now I intend to use <strong>Web as the Knowledgebase</strong>.</p>
<p>With Semantic Web technologies, the whole (read/write) Web can be considered a knowledgebase which can express structured information with Linked Data in the exact same space as typical Web pages and media. A SPARQL graph store can be considered a cache of a little data-oriented chunk of the Web, convenient when rapid operations in a particular scope are needed.</p>
<p>(I arrived at this handy intuition years back, just remembered, I&#39;m overdue in restating it).
