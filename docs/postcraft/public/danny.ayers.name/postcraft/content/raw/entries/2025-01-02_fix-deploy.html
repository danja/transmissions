        <h1>Semem Fix &amp; Deploy</h1>
<p>I made a todo list here yesterday without any explanation. Didn&#39;t publish. Invisible todo list is absolutely not what I want on my blog front page! My top priority this week is doc organisation, so I&#39;ll let myself off this time. I&#39;ve changed the date on the file, this is it I&#39;ll now fill it out...</p>
<p>A little job for this morning is a little explore of <a href=\"https://github.com/danja/semem\">Semem</a>.</p>
<p>It appears to (mostly) work, here&#39;s the <a href=\"https://danny.ayers.name/entries/2025-01-01_semem-run.html\">console log of a run</a>.</p>
<p>But, <strong>what is it doing?</strong></p>
<p>What I want right now, as a bit of scaffolding for what I want to explore, is a nodejs version of <a href=\"https://github.com/caspianmoon/memoripy\">memoripy</a> that uses a (remote) SPARQL store as (part of) its knowledgebase.</p>
<p>I only tried running it after many hours implementing it in a Claude project. Then had a couple of hours manually tweaking to get it to (mostly) run. It&#39;s definitely interacting with Ollama for embeddings &amp; chat, a SPARQL endpoint for persistence. I don&#39;t see the extracted concepts in the SPARQL store.</p>
<p>Last night I had a short session with Claude, aiming to document what we had so far. I&#39;ve put the artifacts over here : <a href=\"https://github.com/danja/semem/tree/main/docs/description_2025-01-01.md\">https://github.com/danja/semem/tree/main/docs/description_2025-01-01.md</a> It sounds marvellous, but how much is true?</p>
<h2>Banebane</h2>
<p>I had a chat with ClaudioB yesterday morning, pointed him to my notes so far on #:semem. He asked me if I had a <strong>live instance</strong> he could play with. A very good question! Not for the first time I&#39;ll quote -</p>
<h3>Connolly&#39;s Bane</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;The bane of my existence is doing things that I know the
computer could do for me&quot;</strong>
\\â€“ Dan Connolly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Which reminded me I&#39;ve not been in touch with <a href=\"https://www.ninebynine.org/\">Graham Klyne</a> for many years. A blog post of his drew my attention to that quote. Good-o, he&#39;s on Mastodon : <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@gklyne\">@gklyne@indieweb.social</a>, I&#39;ll ping him there.</em></p>
<p>ClaudioB&#39;s question is the kind of message I want my #:hyperdata systems to be able to deal with automatically.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how this human agent is handling it :</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>[prompt]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a live instance of Semem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[me]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>immediate response, &quot;not yet&quot;</li>
<li>reformulate question in terms of concrete requirements
-&gt;</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>(functioning, good-enough) Semem</li>
<li>hosting</li>
<li>deployment infrastructure</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1 : all I really need to do right away is minor bugfixing and whatever&#39;s needed to use existing online LLMs
For 2 : I&#39;ve got a live Ubuntu server (which you are looking at now) and a domain name registered for a related plan, some nginx proxying already in place.<br>For 3 : I&#39;ve got a Docker container in-progress for this stuff, <a href=\"https://github.com/danja/tbox\">tbox</a></p>
<ul>
<li>meta-reasoning - evaluate this against existing dev paths, consider priorities, time needed etc</li>
</ul>
<p>On this point there&#39;s a green flag to go ahead, it&#39;s near-enough in line with what I was planning to do already, slight rearrangement of immediate priorities.</p>
<hr>
<p>I acted in several roles there. Humans are good at this. I want a community of independent autonomous intelligent agents (on #:kia).</p>
<p>Ops. Azzurra just reminded me that I&#39;ve an appointment with her up at the comune at 15:00. Now 13:12. Clever Azzurra has me sussed. I&#39;d completely forgotten. But she&#39;s given me just the right amount of time to pop this online, take Claudio out for a short walk, find some clean clothes &amp; have a wash.  </p>
<h2>Soon...</h2>
<p>Somewhere around my vocabs I need terms for this particular kind of input. I may already have something like <strong>Feature Request</strong> around the project management oriented bits, but it totally ties in with agent-oriented messaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>#:todo fix #:semem failing on UPDATE</li>
<li>#:todo tease next steps from <code>semem/docs/description_2024-12-30/</code></li>
