<p>I&#39;ve just given myself a headache doing a little bit of real-world admin. I got a little bit of money through yesterday, I&#39;ve been attempting to direct into the best places...</p>
<p>Including cancelling the €22/month Google One account I&#39;d accidentally signed up for. Grr, only noticed after 3? months. All I need is the €3/m extra storage. I&#39;m actually at 201.03 GB, so am doing a bit of backup in the background right now.</p>
<hr>
<p>A deeper headache is due to me getting overwhelmed by TODOs again (it&#39;s an #ADHD thing).</p>
<p>My long-term solution is the #farelo project. Job One-ish there is capturing descriptions of projects/tasks in #RDF with the <a href=\"https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/project/\">Project Vocabulary</a>. (That needs revising, which I&#39;ve been dipping into occasionally in <a href=\"https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/project/2024/\">2024</a>, but that&#39;s not a big issue today).</p>
<p>While thinking about <a href=\"https://foaf-retro.hyperdata.it/\">foaf-retro</a>, making a <a href=\"https://danny.ayers.name/entries/2024-08-28_form-a-matic.html\">Form-a-matic</a> seemed a good idea.</p>
<p>One way of skipping out of the overwhelmedness kind of task paralysis is doing something new. This is in the distraction, #yak direction, but sometimes that&#39;s necessary. If the new thing has clearly defined, nearby, goal, then the sidestep can work.</p>
<h2>Form-a-matic</h2>
<p><em>requirements, second pass</em></p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Generate HTML forms based on RDF shapes<sup><a id=\"footnote-ref-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup> which, when filled in, will generate RDF instance data. The FOAF-a-matic and DOAP-a-matic being examples.</p>
<p>This will be an application of #Transmissions.</p>
<p>I want to get Claude to do most of the work.</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>My initial <a href=\"https://danny.ayers.name/entries/2024-08-28_form-a-matic.html\">Form-a-matic</a> process is more general than I need right now. Also it would be nicer for the resulting a-matic-form to be relatively self-contained (ie. not involving a SPARQL store).</p>
<p>The input is an example of the target RDF data.</p>
<ol>
<li>variable fields are identified</li>
<li>HTML form elements are created corresponding to those fields</li>
<li>Javascript is attached to a button on on the form to read the field values</li>
<li>JS functions will generate RDF from the form values</li>
</ol>
<p>Possibly the quickest way of achieving most of this would be using generic text templating throughout (a la #SPARQLDiamonds). But I reckon it&#39;ll be neater, and potential more easily extendable if I use an RDF model in the JS.</p>
<p>I <em>so</em> want to use SPARQL here, but side project in my queue is documenting <a href=\"https://rdf-ext.org/\">RDF-Ext</a>. That includes <a href=\"https://github.com/rdf-ext/grapoi\">grapoi</a>, a &#39;Universal RDF/JS graph traverser&#39;. There are also readers/serializers nearby, and I&#39;ve already been using it around #Transmissions.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s :</p>
<ul>
<li>start with some tweaked <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)\">Turtle</a>-format <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF\">FOAF</a>. Give the places of interest keyword-style markers</li>
<li>parse that out and locate those markers with RDF-Ext, recording their path inside the graph</li>
<li>for each marker, generate a form field</li>
</ul>
<p>The end result form will need boilerplate JS functions for taking the form values and the RDF path, constructing the required triples.</p>
<p>To get Claude to do the drudge work without being stupid I&#39;m going to have to prepare some prompts, some background material to put into a Claude Project and some examples.</p>
<p>The other day I set up Transmissions&#39; CLI so it could use an application from any file path, so I guess this might be a good point to set up yet another GitHub repo : <a href=\"https://github.com/danja/trans-apps\">trans-apps</a></p>
<p>TODO allow applications to be loaded from URLs</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ll publish this and then it&#39;s dogwalk time, then I&#39;m of out for a coffee &amp; shopping with Mari.</p>
