<p>My interweb connection has mostly been 0b/S since yesterday morning. Problem started coincident with a rainstorm. Almost certainly down to the antenna here being a bit out of line.</p>
<p>My service provider is generally pretty good, which is fortunate because right now they&#39;re the only real option for me here. Friendly &amp; helpful, but clearly short of field engineers - we are up in the  hills. (I&#39;ve been tempted to ping them about work even though I don&#39;t have transport - I get the feeling they might be desperate enough to find a workaround).</p>

<p>#:aside I was a total bookworm from an early age (until I moved to this harder drug when the Web came along). Odd really, I&#39;m not sure how it started. Even though both my parents were very hot on education, neither were big readers, not a bookish family. But incredibly lucky in how it opened the world to me. Anyhow, my English language mechanical skills got to be really good, I had automatic correct usage (I&#39;m crap at other languages, btw). But nowadays my spelling is... hesitant. The exposure to en-US online and a fair bit of Italian has scrambled it, I have to double check all the time. Ditto my grammar. Both understandable, I don&#39;t feel bad. But my bloody punctuation is broken too! Example just now ^^^, putting a whole sentence in braces. Where, by the Frenchman&#39;s f&#39;ing&#39; <em>fin</em> does the full stop/period go..?       </p>

<p>Ok, what I have been working on (always) is heavily dependent on the Web. But I still have vast numbers of things to do which don&#39;t need it. No problem. Hah!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been fortunate in only having experienced sexual impotence a couple of times in my life, despite having a taste for the booze. Found it slightly embarrassing, very frustrating (tragic on a one-night stand). But that pales in comparison with having to wait, possibly a day or two, for an engineer to get here.</p>
<p>Claudio and I are not long back from walk #1, I&#39;ve just been getting my breath back. I noticed coming in that my antenna is <em>securely</em> mounted by means of cable ties to a drainpipe. So I&#39;m now going to get out the ladders and give it a wiggle. Even if I had a clue about what freqs it operates on it&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ve a suitable meter. But I do have <strong>ping</strong> (on termux) on my phone.
