<p><em>I&#39;ll use this post as my sample for This Site Requires below</em></p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve written this down anywhere yet, although the core idea certainly isn&#39;t new [^2].</p>
<p>Instead of automatically posting material to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.., post it in a space you control first. Only then share any of <strong>your own content</strong> on the big $-motivated platforms. And only share as little or as much as you want to, on a case-by-case basis. Copy &amp; paste everything, get AI to write a summary, only post a link. <strong>Your choice</strong>.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve still not adopted the principle (? better word?) myself, despite having the provider of what you&#39;re looking at under my own control (cheapo quasi-bare metal virtual server, nginx and a bunch of node code). Aside from the elephant in the cyberspace that this site ain&#39;t much to look at (<em>yet!</em>), there are some key elements I need to work on a bit first :</p>
<h2>This Site Requires</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - firstly in the broadest sense, presenting this stuff in a form that will work ok for most people on common devices. But high on the list are using some of the techniques of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\">Web Accessibility</a> to remove tech obstacles that might limit the potential audience.</li>
<li><strong>Modalities</strong> - other aspects of the same kind of thing, focusing on supporting multiple devices, multiple media. I don&#39;t yet have a workflow for easily publishing video &amp; audio <em>Homepage First</em>. Very low-hanging fruit in this domain is giving the site a feed : Atom format first (because I was on the WG, I think it&#39;s the only RFC with my name in it).</li>
<li><strong>SEO (Ho-ho-ho)</strong> - page metadata, rich snippety things, so that links posted to the platforms, search results etc. have a decent preview</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m framing <strong>Homepage First</strong> as a (lazy<sup><a id=\"footnote-ref-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup>) campaign. I&#39;ll do a proper <em>launch</em> when I&#39;ve got my systems set up to capture comments etc. (This will be lazy<sup><a id=\"footnote-ref-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup> again - I&#39;ll just post a link here and there. I&#39;ve given myself an artificial deadline of 2024-10-31 for announcing the release of a load of <em>unfinished</em> work, I&#39;ll chuck this in).</p>
<h3>Footlings</h3>
<p>[1^]: &#39;Homepage&#39; was best <em>(but still not great)</em> signifier for the space I could come up with was &#39;Homepage&#39;. I bet the proportion of people that knows what that means has actually <em>declined</em> over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>[2^]: Related material will appear around here soon. I currently have documenting specific bits of history (<strong>#:FOAF!</strong>) as a priority job. But the whole <em>milieu-milieu</em> around trends in social media, the Web and tech at large and the status of <strong>Open Social</strong> (as a good-enough umbrella term) is due a revisit, so my todo list is a bit broader.  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, I also dislike <strong>&#39;upcycling&#39;</strong>. Ok, the principle sounds ok - recycling and adding value (eg. environmental or artistic). But if you&#39;re making something, using recycled materials and being environment-friendly should be the defaults, not <strong>virtue-signaling nonsense</strong> over using a feather to repaint an ugly plain vase to make it an uglier decorated vase.
Oh yeah, and <strong>&#39;proactive&#39;</strong>, what is that beyond management babble meaning <strong>active</strong>. Ok, like &#39;hacktivism&#39; and &#39;upcycling&#39; I suppose it has value in <strong>wankiness-signalling</strong>.

<li id=\"footnote-3\">
<p>I do have strong views on quite a lot of things, but simply can&#39;t be bothered doing much beyond living my life the way I do, occasionally stating my position and/or trolling on Twitter. Passive-activism (including inacto-pacifism). Also <strong>I dislike the term &#39;hacktivism&#39;</strong>. In the current socio-politico-economic climate, hacking (in every sense except the nasty rip-off stuff) is inherently a form of activism. Fixing your own music system, making your own gadgets, all are a form of non-violent direct action.
