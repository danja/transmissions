        <h1>Mr. Brown</h1>
<p>(as posted to FB)</p>
<p>At desk coding, YouTube reggae compilation on in the background. Music that has enough drive to keep me going, few surprises to distract.</p>
<p>Totally distracted by this.</p>
<p>Bob Marley&#39;s near-enough &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, called &quot;Mr.Brown&quot; [1]</p>
<p>I&#39;ve a feeling I know it very well, but very past life (The flip side  &quot;Dracula&quot; is same tune instrumental, likely been dubbed a lot).
Produced by Lee Perry. I would not have guessed. /s</p>
<p>It&#39;s close to &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot; [2] melodically, but philosophically not a little &quot;Cheree&quot; [3].
(Time I did another version myself... I did do a straight, appropriately bad cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; [4] 9 years ago, but my &quot;Vicar John&quot; from around then is more interesting, and now I really want to do &quot;Roller Girl&quot; [5] while I&#39;ve still got birthday henna in my hair...Have I ever actually recorded a version of &quot;Wild Thing&quot;..?).</p>
<p>The lyrics to Mr. Brown are suitably out-there, copy &amp; paste version I found :</p>
<p>[[
[Verse 1]
(Who is Mr. Brown?)
Mr. Brown is a clown
Who rides through town in a coffin
(Where can he be found?)
In the coffin where there is three crows on top
And two is laughing</p>
<p>[Verse 2]
Oh, what a confusion, ooh, yeah, yeah
What a botheration, ooh, now, now
Who is Mr. Brown? I wanna know now
He is nowhere to be found</p>
<p>[Chorus]
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin&#39; around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin&#39; around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown</p>
<p>[Verse 3]
I wanna know who (Is Mr. Brown?)
Is Mr. Brown controlled by remote?

Oh, calling duppy conqueror
I&#39;m the ghost catcher
This is your chance
Oh, big, big Bill bull-bucka
Take your chance
Prove yourself, oh yeah</p>
<p>[Verse 4]
Down in parade
People running like a masquerade
The police make a raid
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, think it fade</p>
<p>[Verse 5]
What a thing in town
Crows, chauffeur-driven around
Skanking as if they had never known
The man they call Mr. Brown
I can tell you where he&#39;s from now</p>
<p>[Outro]
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin&#39; around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown...
