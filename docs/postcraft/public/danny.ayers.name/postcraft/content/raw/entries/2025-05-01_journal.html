<h2>Mayday!</h2>
<p>Yesterday, indirectly prompted by something Inky danbri was working on, I wound up creating <em>yet another project</em>.</p>
<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/danja/wstore\">wstore</a></h2>
<p>A simple Node.js HTTP server and command-line client for file storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>Something I wanted for #:semem was an object store. Like a filesystem interface but with slightly more useful, webbier, addressing. I had looked into <code>minion</code>? something like that - a store you could run locally but has the same interface as something AWS. Too much overhead for my purposes. This made me realise what I wanted was <em>really dumb</em> object store. It should also be <strong>webbier</strong>. <em>D&#39;oh!</em> <strong>Just use HTTP</strong> + filesystem. I&#39;m working in node (ES modules), Express has this pretty much covered out of the box. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE plus HTTP Basic auth will do me. I set Claude at the task.
As a sanity check, and so I had a clue on how to interface with it programmatically, I also wanted a matching CLI client. Basically a simple <code>curl</code> in node.
