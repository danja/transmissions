        <h1>Semem POC</h1>
<p><em>First-thing morning ramblings, deep sea trawling for actionables again</em></p>
<p>I have two upcoming deadlines I&#39;ve set myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:PoggiPivot 2025-01-05 - get my #:hyperdata project docs sorted</li>
<li>#:ProofPivot 2025-01-14 - proofs of concept for projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Both racing towards me. But that&#39;s the whole idea, use the purely artificial urgency to motivate myself to <strong>focus</strong>. Success at achieving the goals is secondary, reflected in the fact I haven&#39;t actually written down those criteria yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, since setting these I&#39;ve made a good start on them for <a href=\"https://github.com/danja/semem\">Semem</a> (Semantic Memory). Which has highlighted one particular flaw in my current processes, that <strong>proof of concept</strong> isn&#39;t actually the phrase I intended in the above.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere</em>, probably in a Claude project, hopefully condensed in a vocab, I have (work on) better terms. But I need to get my docs sorted...</p>
<p>The phrase is/should be closer to <strong>minimum viable product</strong>. But I don&#39;t like this phrase because <strong>product</strong> <em>in this context, in my mind</em> suggests a marketable commodity. As a dyed in the wool Capitalism-sceptic, I have a knee-jerk reaction to this kind of thing. In society at large there is an overarching conflation between a thing&#39;s value in a &quot;noble&quot; utilitarian sense and it&#39;s bottom line <strong>$ value</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Aside</strong> : I have a vague memory of having the same kind of reaction while tech-reviewing some book material by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Powers\">Shelley Powers</a> a good few years ago. <em>(This may be a completely false memory, apologies to Shelley if that&#39;s the case, but it is plausible and moreover nicely fits this narrative, &quot;don&#39;t let the truth get in way...&quot; and all that).</em>  Shelley is one of my heros of the Web-tech world, and a bloody good writer. But in this particular chapter she made repeated use of phrases like &quot;business rules&quot;. Which I repeatedly criticised. There is a legitimate definition of &quot;business&quot; in this context, to paraphrase &quot;the important stuff&quot;. But still in my mind the conflation with business in the common-English commercial activity sense made my hackles rise. </p>
<p>(Btw, I am an experienced reviewer, and key to that role is drawing attention to text that <em>might not</em> be quite right. It might well be fine. But I&#39;d say the diligent reviewer should err a little on the side of caution, flag things where suspicions are raised. As an experienced writer, Shelley would know many of such flags were tentative, a legitimate response being to reject them after a cursory mental check - which she probably did in this instance, if it ever happened. For sure, iffy crit is a pain and any crit can be demoralising when you get a downpour (I&#39;d be one of many reviewers doing this). But the patience of Job and thick skin are job requirements.)</p>
<p>Any road... I do hope I did get some clear and accurate terminology nailed down for POC/MVC. Neutral language in the sense of not carrying misleading baggage. What I&#39;m after is more like &quot;demonstration of utility&quot;. <strong>Clunky, eh</strong>.</p>
<h2>Semem Demonstration of Utility</h2>
<p>I delighted myself with the hubris I got into my working description of #:semem :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=\"https://github.com/danja/semem\">Semem</a> is an LLM-compatible context-aware, open-ended graph knowledgebase system combining the advantages of vector embeddings and Linked Data technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what am I aiming for by 2025-01-14? I actually have an immediate use case with low-end requirements :</p>
<p><strong>A system I can point to my local FS containing scattered markdown notes etc etc so I can use the stuff efficiently.</strong></p>
<p>I reckon a baseline #:Semem needs to :</p>
<ul>
<li>provide simple similarity search</li>
<li>cluster related topics at different scales</li>
<li>create quasi-formalised annotation (metadata)</li>
<li>make a disorganised, heterogenous corpus addressable as a coherent entity</li>
<li>exploit LLMs (and maybe trad reasoning) to facilitate new knowledge discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, I have some actionables. Mari&#39;s picking me up in 15 mins to go for a coffee and I&#39;m not yet out of bed.</p>
