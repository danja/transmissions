        <h1>Slow Wit? Slow It.</h1>
<p>I just had another experience where being slow at getting something done led to an increase in overall efficiency. Time for a #:semtag for the phenomenon : #:slowit.</p>
<p>The usual one I get is when something is on the procrastination pile, I think of a better way of doing it. I am slow-witted, but that&#39;s offset by experience and persistence. I keep returning to the same problems again and again, intermittently but over a long time scale, not a bad process. Not unlike <em>sleep on it</em>, somewhere nearby is <em>measure twice, cut once</em>.</p>
<p>This time it related to an #:electronics project, appropriately enough a <strong>delay</strong> effects module for the Eurorack #:synth. I figured out a design ages ago, as far as front panel layout which I&#39;d sketched in LibreOffice Draw. But I can&#39;t find my original circuit notes (probably hand-drawn, this is a one-off build). I like the panel layout, but it isn&#39;t labeled for function of pots &amp; sockets, so I&#39;ve been kind of backwards engineering what I had in mind...</p>
<p>Last night I got to a design that I reckoned was worth trying on breadboard, but still didn&#39;t feel quite right. On dogwalk just now it occurred to me that a twisty bit of signal mixing I had on two of the outputs was not only unnecessary but would actually make the thing <em>less</em> versatile. By not proceeding with the prototyping I&#39;ve saved myself a lot of experimentation time, a chunk of cognitive load, a bit of construction time, and at least 4 (possibly 8) op amps.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll write up the project (codename #:redballoons) once I&#39;ve got my write-up process sorted a bit better.
