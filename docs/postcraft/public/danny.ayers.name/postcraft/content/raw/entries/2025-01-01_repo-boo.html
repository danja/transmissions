<p>Very annoying. I&#39;ve been using Claude projects <strong>heavily</strong> for recent dev. Made possible by <a href=\"https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix\">repomix</a> which essentially does an annotated concat of a repo&#39;s files. Tonight my thing decided to say:</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/transmissions$ npm run rp

&gt; transmissions@1.0.0 rp
&gt; repomix -c repomix.config-small.json . &amp;&amp; repomix -c repomix.config-large.json .

ðŸ“¦ Repomix v0.2.12

Error: Config file not found at repomix.config-small.json

<p>I&#39;ve no idea what I&#39;ve done that would impact there. Can&#39;t remember if this is running a global or local install. Ok, first thing, clear caches and try again. &quot;Hey Claude, how do I..?&quot;</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
</code></pre>
<p>While that&#39;s running, there is something else I want to do nearby. Squat the npm registry with a couple of things. #:transmissions &amp; #:semem at least, there might be a couple of others. None will be out-of-the-box usable as they should be (as I would interpret proper etiquette), but I think I&#39;m at a point where I can legitimately grab those names. I&#39;ve put loads of work in, am committed to making them useful for other parties.</p>
<p>It might even encourage me to get the GitHub CI/CD bits in place (for the badges, innit).</p>
<p>Golly :</p>

npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.

<p>Aw, <code>npm install squirt</code> works (whatever that is), I&#39;d have squatted that too. Ok, no biggy.</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">npm install squirty

<p>For that I only need to do some minor renaming. #:transmissions would have been a proper pain. I did it once already - had the project working label &quot;treadmill&quot; initially, but decided something more accurately descriptive would be better. Horrible search &amp; replace - not too bad with code, but docs got messy.
