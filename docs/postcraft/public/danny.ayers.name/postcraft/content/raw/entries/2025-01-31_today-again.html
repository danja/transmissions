        <h1>Today Again</h1>
<p><em>Long day yesterday, late night. Imagine my surprise when I woke this morning to find it was today again.</em></p>
<p>#:todo note about moving from Docker to Podman for #:tbox</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been going round in circles figuring out how best to do PDF-markdown conversion. It&#39;s must-have for #:semem, useful elsewhere. I want to run it from node...somehow. One option was PDF.js but that&#39;s intended for browser use, it depends on facilities there. Another was the Poppler toolkit, it depends on native facilities. But that should be ok in the #:tbox container.</p>
<p>It makes sense to do the operation in two phases : pdf2html, html2md.</p>
<p>The shape of this - small processors - is such that it has to live in #:transmissions.  </p>
<p>Which suggests to me a little subsystem MVP :</p>
<ul>
<li>pdf2md is accessible via http in #:tbox</li>
<li>the endpoint URL is exposed by #:semem</li>
<li>calls to the endpoint are routed to a #:transmissions application</li>
<li>#:transmissions processors do the workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>I have at least sketched out a processor to do bash calls in #:transmissions, so that&#39;s kinda in place. How far did I get with #:transmissions&#39; HTTP API..?</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-prompt\">We need to work on the HTTP API. Reference the code in project knowledge under `src/api`
On the command `./trans -web -port 4200  system/echo` the system should spawn a http server listening on localhost, port 4200. When a HTTP POST is made to that endpoint, the server should check for a field named &#39;message&#39; and then run the transmission `system/echo` on it, and then pass the final value of &#39;message&#39; back as the body of the HTTP response.
The transmission `system/echo` defined in `src/applications/system/echo/transmissions.ttl` simply uses a `ShowMessage` processor to output the contents of the message to the console. Something like the functionality of `src/processors/util/ShowMessage.js` needs to be built into the server to provide the response, formatted as appropriate.

Currently, when asking for HTTP, the system crashes like so:
```sh
./trans -w -p 4200  system/echo

</code></pre>
<p>Have a good think how the required functionality can be built into the system based on what&#39;s in place already.</p>

<p>Ok, got a good way towards that before tokens ran out. Dogwalk, then food &amp; feet up. </p>

<h2>Corps Blimey</h2>
<p>I needed a term for a chunk of knowledge that (<em>hand-waves</em>) is bigger than a doc or little graph, but smaller than a corpus. Obvious really : #:corpuscle. Unintentionally I seem to have slipped into alliteration. This will mean there will be such things as #cogcom <strong>Cognitive Composer Corpuscles</strong>. <em>Chaos Computer Club, Creedence Clearwater Revival...oh, oops.</em></p>
<p>Checking with Claude -</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-response\">Key findings:

Corpus (plural: corpora): Body of text/written material or physical body/mass
Corpuscle: Small particle or cell, especially blood cells
Related through Latin root &quot;corpus&quot; meaning body

Common relationship: Both derive from anatomical/physical meanings, though corpus expanded to textual collections.
...
Related words include:

* Corporate/corporation (organized body)
* Incorporate (bring into a body)
* Corpulent (having a large body)
* Corporeal (physical/bodily)
* Corpse (dead body)
