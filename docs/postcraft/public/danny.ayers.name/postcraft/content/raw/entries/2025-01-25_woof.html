<p><em>There are hunters with dogs nearby, Claudio&#39;s really agitated.</em></p>
<p> Before getting out of bed, in my waking-up research session I got annoyed (again) at my notetaking setup. On the phone I currently use <a href=\"https://github.com/gsantner/markor\">Markor</a> markdown editor, which is autosync&#39;ed with my desktop using <a href=\"https://syncthing.net/\">SyncThing</a>. I have dev in progress on #:squirt for improving this, but the frustration did give me an idea: in-browser editor, two-pane, using #:semtags as hyperlinks that when double-clicked in one pane, they open the corresponding URL in the other pane. Worth a #:spike! So I did a little dev with Claude (while still in bed). Got some starter code, and with my initial prompt and Claude&#39;s handover doc there should be enough to take it forward as and when. Even if the idea is a good one, the implementation won&#39;t be properly useful until I have a bit more infrastructure - #:tbox, specifically #:semem - in place. So I&#39;ve dumped all the in the #:squirt part of the #:farelo repo for now. Now at desk, onto that infrastructure.</p>
<p>One thing that led me to the above is that I always struggle to remember where I&#39;m up to with things. Being able to nav to (sub)project status/next steps quickly is must-have. My org is lousy right now, finding things hard. The idea of having One Big Top Level (<em>yay! got a name for my reggae soundsystem</em>) doc crossed my mind. Maybe... But hypertext, for heavens sake...patience Danny. I need #:semem to do search asap.</p>
<ol>
<li>make a #:transmission to walk fs, post files off to SPARQL server (in #:tbox, but not tightly coupled)</li>
<li>bit of UI - HTML form with Claude&#39;s help I guess quickest</li>
<li>get #:semem to build index</li>
<li>search form</li>
</ol>
<p>I ended up spending the morning tidying up #:semem, getting tests in sync with code. Ran out of Claude tokens.

<h2>semem CLI</h2>
<p><code>semem create store hyperdata</code></p>
<p>creates a SPARQL dataset at default URI (Fuseki API how, GSP?)</p>
<p><code>semem index [URI]</code></p>
<p>I want articles stored as named graphs. How best to do containment?</p>
<p>Hmm. Graphs that only contain indexes? Stick indexes in default graph?
