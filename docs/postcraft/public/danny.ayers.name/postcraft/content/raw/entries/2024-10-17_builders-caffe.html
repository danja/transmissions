<p>My essential daytime beverage is <strong>Caffé Americano, Macchiato, à la Turk</strong>.</p>
<p>In the UK I used to drink the classic <strong>Brit Instant</strong>. One or two spoonfuls of powder from a jar, in a mug, good splash of milk, spoonful of sugar. Of necessity, usually the cheap stuff, but Nescafé by preference and/or in posh company.
I can&#39;t bear the silage run-off now.</p>

<p>Christ on an e-bike, so many distractions today. Oriana just called, due up from Siena in 10 mins, asked if I can give her a hand shifting stuff.</p>

<p>Golly, via Duolingo, a name I believe I recognise from the distant past, #:foaf <a href=\"https://jtauber.com\">James Tauber</a>. I can&#39;t place him yet, my mental sorting office will take a while to locate the relevant pile.  I doubt I know him through his main field, he does lots of Ancient Greek as <a href=\"https://jktauber.com\">J.K. Tauber</a> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>at the intersection of computing, linguistics, philology, and learning science</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has written up <a href=\"https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web/\">My History with the Web</a>, which mentions the W3C, may be a hint for the backend posties.
This project of his I must #:todo revisit : <a href=\"https://modelling-music.com\">https://modelling-music.com</a></p>
<p>#:todo come up with a short #:semtag that I&#39;ll remember for check it out/revisit.</p>
<p>Reminds me, I need to see if I got around to doing one of these : <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/jtauber\">https://linktr.ee/jtauber</a></p>
<p>His <em>History</em> is on <a href=\"https://thoughtstreams.io\">https://thoughtstreams.io</a>, not sure I&#39;ve seen that before. But <strong>microblogging</strong> is very strongly in scope for <em>my stuff</em>, #:todo check it out. Over there the page has :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>get stream as: <a href=\"https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web.md\">markdown</a> or <a href=\"https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web.atom\">atom</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Atom feed follows the usual reverse-chrono sequence of posts (which is kinda irrelevant, they are datetime-stamped). #:todo remember bloody Atom, is important here.</p>
<p>The Markdown feed is forward-chrono (which makes sense here, the <em>History..</em> is a sequential, self-contained article). Just the usual #:md syntax, with <code>---</code> (ie. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>) inserted as post separators.</p>
<p>Coincidentally I woke up this morning with a closely related thing on my mind, #:chunks or for here -</p>
<h2>Chunky Chunks</h2>
<p>I need dynamically modifiable, identifiable blocks of text.</p>
<p><em>to be continued...</em></p>
<p>So many distractions today.
