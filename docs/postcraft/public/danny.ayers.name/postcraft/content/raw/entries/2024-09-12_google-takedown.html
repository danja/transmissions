        <p> Download to my server first? But how, given whatever auth Google is using..? Wireshark to read actual messages?</p>
<p>Claude suggested download to Google Drive first, then other more interesting suggestions, including using Selenium or Puppeteer. I think I played with Selenium a while back, the mock-browser setup would be useful elsewhere for me. To consider.</p>

<p>Asked Grok:</p>
<p>I need to download my email archives from gmail but I have a very unreliable internet connection. For downloading from simple URLs I would use wget -c and resume if the line dropped. When I try downloading the gmail archive from a browser is does have a kind of resume, but doesn&#39;t appear to restart where it left off a lot of the time. It also has quite a complicated URL and it looks like there is some kind of auth involved too. How can I do a reliable, resumable, efficient download?

I understand your concern. Downloading a large email archive from Gmail can be challenging, especially with an unreliable internet connection. Here&#39;s a step-by-step guide to help you download your Gmail archives reliably, resumably, and efficiently:</p>
<p>Method 1: Using wget with Gmail&#39;s API</p>
<p>Gmail provides an API that allows you to download your email archives programmatically. You&#39;ll need to:</p>
<p>Enable the Gmail API for your account:
Go to the Google Cloud Console (<a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/\">https://console.cloud.google.com/</a>) and create a new project.
Navigate to APIs &amp; Services &gt; Library and search for &quot;Gmail API&quot;.
Click on the result, then click on the &quot;Enable&quot; button.
Create credentials for your project (OAuth client ID).
Install the curl and jq command-line tools:
curl is used to send HTTP requests, and jq is used to parse JSON responses.
Use the following command to download your email archives:
curl -X GET <br> <a href=\"https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?labelIds=INBOX&maxResults=1000\">https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?labelIds=INBOX&amp;maxResults=1000</a> <br> -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39; <br> -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; <br> -o messages.json
Replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with the access token obtained from the Google Cloud Console.</p>
<p>This command downloads the first 1000 messages in your inbox. You can adjust the maxResults parameter to change the batch size.</p>
<p>To resume the download, you can use the --continue option with curl:</p>
<p>curl -X GET <br> <a href=\"https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?labelIds=INBOX&maxResults=1000&startMessageId=MESSAGE_ID\">https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?labelIds=INBOX&amp;maxResults=1000&amp;startMessageId=MESSAGE_ID</a> <br> -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39; <br> -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; <br> -o messages.json <br> --continue
Replace MESSAGE_ID with the ID of the last message downloaded.</p>
<p>Method 2: Using wget with Gmail&#39;s IMAP</p>
<p>Gmail provides an IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) interface that allows you to access your email archives. You&#39;ll need to:</p>
<p>Enable IMAP access for your Gmail account:
Go to your Gmail settings (gear icon) &gt; Forwarding and POP/IMAP &gt; Enable IMAP.
Install the wget command-line tool.
Use the following command to download your email archives:
wget -r -l 1 -A imap -P /path/to/download/folder imap://imap.gmail.com
This command downloads all emails from your inbox, using the IMAP protocol. The -r option tells wget to follow links, -l 1 sets the maximum recursion depth to 1, -A imap specifies the file name pattern, and -P sets the download directory.</p>
<p>To resume the download, you can use the --continue option with wget:</p>
<p>wget -r -l 1 -A imap -P /path/to/download/folder --continue imap://imap.gmail.com
Tips and Variations</p>
<p>To download specific labels or folders, modify the labelIds or folder parameter in the API request or IMAP URL.
To download attachments, use the --recursive option with wget and specify the attachment file name pattern.
To download emails in a specific format (e.g., MBOX, EML), use a tool like imap-sync or mbox2eml.
If you encounter issues with authentication or connection timeouts, try using a VPN or a more reliable internet connection.
Remember to respect Gmail&#39;s terms of service and usage limits when downloading your email archives.</p>
