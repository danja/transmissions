        <h1>Carrot</h1>
<p><em>In bed activity this morning was developing terms for the #:rpp ontology to cover incentives : carrot &amp; stick.</em></p>
<p>#:urgent <strong>Leonardo mail</strong> - I promised Mari I&#39;d do it today, <em>That pushes up some #:home #:services things up the list...</em></p>
<p>The past week or so I&#39;ve&#39; a flurry of &quot;new&quot; (sub)projects added to my ToDos. Not exactly new, because they slot nicely into what I have already, but it is a good reminder that I need to nudge on my #:farelo project management bits. Prioritization for productivity, innit.</p>
<p>High on that todo subgraph is capturing project info using #:fam, HTML-form based entry (with auto-generated forms). But deciding which fields to focus on first is tricky. Need more data to inform...</p>
<p>So, #:paliwan, <em>pali wan, kama pini tu</em>, is write some things - from one-line todos to project-level bits down in plain markdown, once I have a few, ask Claude to translate into RDF using #:rpp vocab (later, ask for a script to do the translation automatically - would be a good mini-app for testing a small LLM in #:transmissions).</p>
<p>For now I&#39;ll put material under <code>/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/danny.ayers.name/projects</code></p>
<p>Ooh, this is rather nice. An extra bird is documenting my projects, high on the todos, this should help lubricate.</p>
<p>I could do with sorting out both the Claude (for artifacts) and GitHub (for project list) #:transmissions
