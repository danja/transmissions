<p><em>I&#39;m trying to keep my writing here organised, but a recurring problem is the daily raw stuff. I&#39;m going to give up on ahead-of-time org, just accept there&#39;ll usually be a dump page.</em></p>
<h2>Transmissions Message Cloning Issue</h2>
<p>in <code>Processor.executeQueue()</code>
<code>src/model/Processor.js</code></p>
<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">/* structuredClone makes a deep copy of the message object
           *  so that the original message is not modified
           *  except its depth doesn&#39;t appear to cover internal objects
           *  so here the app.dataset is passed between messages
           *  (which is fine)
           */
           const dataset = message.app.dataset
           message = structuredClone(message)
           message.app.dataset = dataset
</code></pre>
<p>This is needed anywhere messages get copied. Right now I need to add it to <code>DirWalker</code> and <code>ForEach</code>. <em>How did I do the JSON treewalker? Maybe there too.</em></p>
<p>./trans  -v config-setting-manifest tests/applications/config-setting-manifest</p>
<p>I should really read up more on this (and write it up, it&#39;s a little tarpit that I doubt is well-known). I did look into it briefly a few months ago. <em>Was one approach serializing objects, copying, deserialising</em>.
This approach is ok for now, but does feel like a kludge. I bet there&#39;s a util in #:lodash. Whatever, I&#39;ll isolate it in <code>src/utils/SysUtils.js</code></p>
<h2>Integration tests based on applications (and #:simples)</h2>
<p>Prompted by the issue above.</p>
<h2>tbox Startup Issue</h2>
<p><code>docker-compose</code> needs changing for a healthier #:Fuseki</p>
<p><code>/home/danny/hyperdata/tbox/about.md</code></p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">sudo systemctl stop tbox
cd ~/hyperdata/tbox # my local dir
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
</code></pre>

<p>Heh, BBC R4 Woman&#39;s Hour just used the phrase &quot;work-life balance&quot;. I need to mention that in #:adhd notes, it makes as much sense to me as &quot;literature-earthworm balance&quot;. Except I&#39;ve already thought of several ways the latter could be interpreted and realised &quot;earthworm-earthworm balance&quot; would probably be a better equivalent. Work is stuff you do, ie. life. In the <em>job</em> sense, there&#39;s an aspect where you get given money, but that&#39;s tangential to the living. It&#39;s either comparing apples and oranges or comparing <em>this</em> apple with <em>this same</em> apple. No wonder I&#39;m hopeless at getting an income.
