<p>Posted somewhere in the early hours last night</p>
<p>I really like sound of this version of &#39;Blue Monday&#39;,</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLbaOLWjpc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLbaOLWjpc</a></p>
<p>but there are many, many things about the video that annoy me. A small sample :</p>
<ul>
<li>that&#39;s a cruddy monochord (I made one as a pressie for oor Nigel, much  more practical &amp; prettier)</li>
<li>the sig gen looks at least late 40s</li>
<li>voice short delay effect - how? It&#39;s generally taken that the first time an artificial reverb effect was used was in 1947. The producer&#39;s bathroom, for this : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIuX7IsdE8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIuX7IsdE8</a></li>
<li>where is the vocal chorus coming from? (Ok, magnetic wire recording had been around a while, tape was just emerging, you could overlay - but they were all really big machines, valve/tube electronics, I don&#39;t see one)</li>
<li>NO-ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS USES RUSTY STRINGS</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all these are coumterbalanced for me by intrigue on the 4-stringed hammered thing (what is that called?) and most of all by imagining - Stephen Morris drum roll, tss tss tss...</p>
<p>Peter Hook playing a banjolele.</p>
<p>(I&#39;ve actually got one, they are probably the most ridiculous instrument in human history. A meeting of the best engineering and craftwor., The end result having the worst features of both banjos and ukuleles.
I&#39;m guessing me dad found it in a charity shop. Has been desperately in need of repair for decades, this might be motivation for me to get around to it. Also the mandolin sharing the same cardboard box I got from a car boot sale years back, which had no back and a broken front, which I <em>did</em> resurrect - so badly it has needed gluing back together since a week after my fix- accursed kerfs!).</p>
<p>How does it feel?</p>
