<p>PS. I realised I needed easy access to the actual project repos from Pulsar for editing README.md etc, so I renamed the symlinks of the #:postcraft sections to eg. <code>semem-docs</code>. Also changed theme.  I like this combo.</p>
<p>I had started using git submodules to organise my code subprojects (of #:hyperdata, the umbrella). This turned out to be a bad idea. First, a bit of extra admin needed (and remembering these things were submodules) and then things started getting really confusing when I wanted to integrate the #:clients subproject into various other subprojects, one submodule into other submodules... Way too much #:CognitiveLoad.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m simplifying :</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">danny@danny-desktop:~$ tree -L 1 hyperdata/

hyperdata/
├── clients
├── hyperdata
├── semem
├── tbox
└── transmissions
</code></pre>
<p>Each of those (and the rest) will be a completely independent repo/module. This change is fairly straightforward, the only bit that will need special attention is <code>hyperdata</code>, it needs to forget the submodules. I got the procedure for that from Perplexity, will do it once I&#39;m sure everything&#39;s ok in the new structure.</p>
<p>A complication is that I&#39;ve been using Pulsar Editor for docs. This is based on the old Atom editor, and works a treat for this purpose. I did start customizing it as <code>hyperdata-editor</code>, but I managed to break that, so reverted to the original source distro). It manages workspaces a little differently than VSCode and I&#39;ve been using #:postcraft for docs, so to give me what I need in the editor a little bit of symlinking is needed. With this latest setup, so far I&#39;ve done :</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">cd ~/hyperdata/hyperdata/workspaces/postcrafts

ln -s ~/hyperdata/hyperdata/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./hyperdata

ln -s ~/hyperdata/transmissions/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./transmissions
ln -s ~/hyperdata/clients/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./clients
ln -s ~/hyperdata/semem/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./semem
ln -s ~/hyperdata/tbox/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./tbox
...
</code></pre>
<p>Then I opened the first symlink as a folder in Pulsar, I&#39;ll add all the rest as folders to give me easy access to the lot.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also started reorganizing the bits that will be online :</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">danny@danny-desktop:~$ tree -L 2 sites

sites
├── danny.ayers.name
│   └── postcraft
├── hyperdata.it
└── strandz.it
</code></pre>
<p>They are currently all over the place. I&#39;ll fix that as I go along.</p>
<p>PS. Just realised I need to edit the README.md etc from here too, so I&#39;ll add :</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">ln -s ~/hyperdata/tbox ./tbox-repo
</code></pre>
