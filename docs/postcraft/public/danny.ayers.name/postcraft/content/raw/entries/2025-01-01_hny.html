        <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
<p>Foggy brain yet again. Not for the first time on New Year&#39;s Day, but irritatingly I wasn&#39;t up all that late and didn&#39;t drink to excess. I did have fun last night, my first attempt at livestreaming. Around 7pm I was feeling blocked at desk (my head, not the code) and an idea formed in my head. I&#39;d been listening to Drum &amp; Bass. Didn&#39;t seem right, hmm, bagpipes? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjdnGNfDyd4\">Big Bad Bollocks</a>? Pogues? Hang on, is there any D&amp;B in 3/4 or 6/8 time? I decided to make some. By midnight.    </p>
<p>Easiest camera to set up was my Android phone (after I spent half an hour sorting out a tripod). Perplexity suggested Facebook was the easiest platform, but neglected to tell me it has a very confusing UI with sod all settings accessible. Worst, whatever resolution/codec it uses, it&#39;s a network glutton. I&#39;m not sure how much actually got streamed, 50% of the times I checked it was waiting to connect.
