        <h1>Journal 2025-03-21</h1>
<p>Once again I&#39;m having to cycle back in #:transmissions and fix/replace a hacky placeholder. Really annoying, so time-consuming, things I&#39;d forgotten about but I have to fix before moving forward.</p>
<p>Call it <strong>House of Cards</strong> dev. Layers of quick-and-dirty placeholder cards are there to support the next storey, enable investigation further along. First pass, it&#39;s not clear exactly what&#39;s required, so <em>Just Enough</em> is implemented. Later, when the <em>House</em> falls down, down a storey we go, make a brick to fit where the card was.
It&#39;s knowing, <em>strategic</em> build-up of <strong>technical debt</strong>. The annoying part of it is that with a memory like mine, it throws even my lousy time estimates out of the (third storey) window.</p>
<p>What&#39;s kinda ironic is how so many devs are gradually realising how <strong>Vibes</strong> coding with LLMs has a similar effect, yet I&#39;ve been doing this stuff manually.</p>
<p>This time the <code>:Restructure</code> processor. It&#39;s acting on the config (from <code>config.ttl</code>) directly, rather than going up its <code>Processor</code> superclass which (more or less) has the precedence in place to look in <code>manifest.ttl</code> first. That I got working, <code>:Restructure</code> fails.</p>
<p>Hey ho.
