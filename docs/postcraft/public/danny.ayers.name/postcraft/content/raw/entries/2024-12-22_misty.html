        <h1>Misty</h1>
<p><em>It was very misty this afternoon for dogwalk</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve a misty head today, now to ramble a bit to see what condenses.</p>
<p>Nice reminder, #:todo #:squirt handle images etc.</p>
<p>It also reminded me of the name of Led Zep&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6M3YQ_EF2E\">Misty Mountain Hop</a>, but I couldn&#39;t think why that might stick in my head until I had a listen. I really like that &quot;<strong>dog dog dog, doggy dog dog...</strong>&quot;. I bet I&#39;ve already played with it somewhere, but I haven&#39;t a clue where.</p>
<p>This leads straight to my <strong>misty memory</strong>. My memory for day-to-day things is pretty lousy, main workaround being written reminders, lists and lists and lists... But I&#39;ve actually got an exceptionally good memory for things around tech and suchlike, <em>in a sense</em>. Like, the capacity and retention of system ideas is really good, but the connectivity between them is poor, retrieval can often be hopeless. (This is almost certainly an #:adhd thing).</p>
<p>One specific issue comes up regularly. If I&#39;ve got a plan for something worked out, but haven&#39;t been active on it for a little while, I forget which bits I&#39;ve done. Very often I imagine I&#39;ve implemented something I haven&#39;t even started, but that&#39;s not a major problem, because at that point I&#39;ll have a pretty good idea of how to do it. A fun, kind-of example of this is a (probably false) memory I have, of having a dream where I was playing the guitar chords to &quot;Wild Thing&quot; before I&#39;d learned them. Following day I could play it.
I strongly suspect this is a false memory because at the time it would have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVN8_7wVSG0\">Hendrix&#39;s version</a> I&#39;d have had most exposure to, and the version I learned in the dream was open G-C-D-C-G chords on a nylon-strung acoustic, rather different. <em>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zN2wWGbGyM\">Goodies version</a> is quite a thing, though the classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSWInYFVksg\">Troggs version</a> would be my go-to these days. Now where did I leave that ocarina..?</em>  </p>
<p>The converse of this is a relatively minor problem, but one that&#39;s incredibly annoying when it happens. I forget I&#39;ve implemented something and proceed to implement it again. Like buying eggs &amp; potatoes when you&#39;ve already got a larder full of eggs &amp; potatoes. Except they can go into extra <em>tortillas espa√±olas</em>.   </p>
<h2>Actionable : Docs!</h2>
<p>Ah...ok, something has condensed. Sort out project docs. The #:postcraft doc rendering bits are still fresh in my head, this would be a good opportunity. I did a #:transmission a while back to pull a list of my <a href=\"https://github.com/danja?tab=repositories\">GitHub repos</a>. My plan then was to have it pull the <code>README.md</code> for each, use those to bootstrap docs. Slight snag, few had a worthwhile readme, certainly not up-to-date.</p>
<p>But I should be able to identify the currently active repos (they&#39;ll be a bit tangled up in Claude projects too - I&#39;ve quite a lot there yet to find a proper home). There&#39;s my starting point. Writing some readmes should give me good anchor points from which to bootstrap the rest.</p>
<p>First though, a dogwalk in the dark.
