        <h1>RDF in Javascript</h1>
<p>In a past life I used to use Java for everything. The Jena RDF libraries were the go-to. I don&#39;t recall having any major problems using Jena, beyond the usual initial learning curve for a new library.</p>
<p>Most of my coding had/has a browser front end, and when SPARQL came along this gradually changed how I worked with RDF. Ultimately I pretty much stopped using RDF directly in code at all, dealing instead with SPARQL queries &amp; responses. Thing is, most of the time you&#39;re not really interested in the RDF model/datasets as a whole, more like a limited projection relevant to the task or application at hand. For a crude analogy, the Human Resources department doesn&#39;t need the entire corporate database, just the bits related to hiring and firing.</p>
<p>But now I have a need to work with RDF in Javascript. I&#39;ve been using the</p>

Humbled by Javascript!
A block of code gets a series of resources of a given type from an RDF dataset. A
<code>switch(instance){ case a: ...}</code>
directs each for processing.
Error.
So I spent 2 hours looking for a bug in my RDF handling.
I&#39;d forgotten to put <code>return</code> in the cases.
