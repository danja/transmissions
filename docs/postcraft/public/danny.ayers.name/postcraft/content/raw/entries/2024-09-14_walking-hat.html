        <h1>Walking Hat</h1>
<p>The bedroom was chilly last night so I wore a beany hat in bed. I was wearing it when I woke up. Finally found it on the bedside table on the other side of the bed. How it got there is a mystery. I didn&#39;t go over there, it&#39;s not the kind of trick Claudio plays. Which leaves the possibility of rodents...</p>
<p>So it&#39;s Saturday, #ELFQuake day. So I <strong>must</strong> do at least an hour on that.</p>
<p>The dependency tree for that includes a lot of tasks that help elsewhere, so</p>
<p>17:15 and I still haven&#39;t got to code...</p>
<p>Using bit from Markmap :</p>
<p>TODO <code>services/text/MarkdownToJSON.js</code>, <code>services/viz/JSONToSVGTree.js</code></p>
<p>The latter using <code>markmap-lib</code> to have a look at the output shape, because I now reckon for simplicity &amp; reuse, #form-a-matic should have an intermediate JS object representation (so RDF-&gt;JSON...JSON-&gt;HTML), initially a simple tree.</p>

<p>For r/tokipona</p>
<p>The English idiom &quot;to kill two birds with one stone&quot; expresses a very useful concept (to achieve two things with a single action) in a horrible way. I was pleased to find that the Italian equivalent &quot;prendere due piccioni con una fava&quot; is less violent - to catch two pigeons with one bean. There are other variants around Europe <sup><a id=\"footnote-ref-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup>. My geo is terrible, no idea which country has &quot;roast two pieces meat on one fire&quot;, but again that&#39;s a bit less nasty.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like a pleasant English version and to find that, getting it to work in the language of good seems a good approach. So how would you express this in toki pona?</p>
<p>For twitter:</p>
<p>First they came for the Venezualians, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Venezualian.
Then they came for the Haitians, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Haitian.
