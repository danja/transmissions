I am trying to make a responsive web page in a blog style. I want it so that on a large screen, three columns will line
up in the
order directory, articles, about. On a tablet screen, I want the articles to take up the full width, and the directory
and about to be below it next to each other. On a phone screen, I want the articles to be on top, and the directory and
about to be below it in that order. I am trying to use CSS grid to do this. I have the following code so far:

---
In the CSS, I added a new media query for screens up to 1024px wide, and modified the grid properties for each element
to stack them correctly. For screens up to 768px wide, I modified the grid to stack the elements vertically.
