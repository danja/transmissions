# Transmissions : Journal : 2024-11-12

I made another start on tests. Main thing getting `Restructure.js` working properly.

Now `src/applications/claude-json-converter`

I've reverted to the previous style of writing pipes, so instead of :
```turtle
trm:pipe (:walk_convs :uf_convs  :retree1  :walk_msgs :uf_msgs :SM :DE :retree2  :mf :write) .
```

back to :
```turtle
trm:pipe (:p10 :p15 :p20 :p30 :p35 :p40 :p50 :p60) .
```

Using names for the processor instances might have been clearer, but wasn't. Especially when looking at the console :
```sh
| Running >>> :  (p10.p15.p20.p30.p35.p40.p50) p60 a FileWriter
```
