# Transmissions : Journal : 2024-11-14

Continuing `/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/journal/2024-11-12.md`

I need to use `Restructure` in two places right away :
1. render messages from Claude's `conversations.json`
2. get `README.md`s from all my GitHub repos

The data for one was confusing, because there is a lot! Even after narrowing down to one `chat_messages` session, I could see what was happening with the structure.

Time to make data a bit less verbose. Replace string values in the JSON with `""`

Got Claude to fill out `Blanker.js` using :
```sh
/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/prompts/2024-11-14_make-blanker.md
```

It did, but I forget the entry in `src/processors/json/JSONProcessorsFactory.js`

Also I'd already forgotten that `FileReader` defaults to putting data in `message.content` (I can't remember if I did this already : #:todo supply data pointer in `FileReader`).

Adjusting for these, it works!

So now, pop one of those in `src/applications/claude-json-converter/transmissions.ttl`

Aha!

```
"content": {
  "payload": [
    {
```

#:todo the `rename` in `Restructure` is actually a copy. Refactor into `move`, `copy`, `remove`

Grrr. Maybe problem was elsewhere. `src/processors/json/JSONWalker.js` is a bit hardcoded.
