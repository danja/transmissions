File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

# HTTP Server Implementation Handover

## Components
1. HttpServer (processors/http/HttpServer.js)
   - Main processor class
   - Manages worker thread
   - Handles configuration
   - Emits messages/errors

2. HttpServerWorker (processors/http/HttpServerWorker.js)  
   - Express server implementation
   - Message-based control
   - Static file serving
   - Shutdown endpoint

## Configuration (RDF)
```turtle
@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .
@prefix t: <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/> .

t:ServerConfig a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:port 3000 ;
    trm:basePath "/" ;
    trm:staticPath "data/static" ;
    trm:cors false ;
    trm:timeout 30000 ;
    trm:maxRequestSize "1mb" .
```

## Usage
1. Add HttpServer to transmissions.ttl
2. Configure in config.ttl
3. Server shuts down on POST to /shutdown
4. Status tracked via worker messages

## Integration Points
- WorkerPool.js - optional worker management
- Processor lifecycle
- Message events
- Configuration system

## Current Status
- Core implementation complete
- Additional features can be added:
  - Security middleware
  - Dynamic routes
  - WebSocket support

# HTTP Server Implementation Plan

## 1. Core Components

### HttpServer Processor
- Extends base Processor class
- Manages worker thread for server
- Handles graceful shutdown
- Implements required interfaces

### Worker Thread Implementation
- Express server setup
- Static file serving 
- Shutdown endpoint
- Message passing with main thread

### Configuration
- Port (default 4000)
- Base URL path (/transmissions/test/)
- Static file path
- Allowed methods

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: HttpServer Class
```javascript
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads'
import { EventEmitter } from 'events'
import logger from '../../utils/Logger.js'
import Processor from '../base/Processor.js'
import ns from '../../utils/ns.js'

class HttpServer extends Processor {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config)
    this.port = this.getPropertyFromMyConfig(ns.trm.port) || 4000
    this.basePath = this.getPropertyFromMyConfig(ns.trm.basePath) || '/transmissions/test/'
    this.worker = null
  }
  
  async process(message) {
    // Start server worker
    // Handle messages/shutdown
    // Emit completion
  }
  
  async shutdown() {
    // Graceful shutdown logic
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Express Server Worker Logic
```javascript
// In separate worker.js
import express from 'express'
import { parentPort } from 'worker_threads'

const app = express()

app.post('/shutdown', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Shutting down...')
  parentPort.postMessage('shutdown')
})

app.use('/transmissions/test/', express.static(staticPath))

app.listen(port)
```

### Step 4: Configuration Format
```turtle
@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .
@prefix t: <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/> .

t:ServerConfig a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:port 4000 ;
    trm:basePath "/transmissions/test/" ;
    trm:staticPath "data/input" .
```

## 3. Testing Plan

1. Basic server startup
2. Static file serving
3. Shutdown endpoint
4. Worker thread communication
5. Graceful shutdown
6. Configuration handling

## 4. Integration Points

- WorkerPool.js integration for worker management
- Processor lifecycle hooks
- Message passing protocols
- Configuration parsing

## 5. Error Handling

- Worker startup failures
- Port conflicts
- Static file access errors
- Shutdown timing issues 

## 6. Deployment Structure
```

      config.ttl
      transmissions.ttl
      data/
        input/
          index.html
```

## 7. Next Steps

1. Implement HttpServer.js base structure
2. Create worker thread implementation
3. Add configuration handling
4. Implement shutdown logic
5. Add error handling
6. Create test application
7. Write integration tests

# HTTP Server Message Protocol Specification

## Worker Thread Message Protocol

### Server → Worker Messages

#### Start Server
```javascript
{
  type: 'start',
  config: {
    port: number,          // Server port (default: 3000)
    basePath: string,      // Base URL path (default: '/')
    staticPath: string,    // Path to static files
    cors: boolean,         // Enable CORS (default: false) 
    timeout: number,       // Request timeout in ms (default: 30000)
    maxRequestSize: string // Max request size (default: '1mb')
    rateLimit: {
      windowMs: number,    // Time window for rate limiting (default: 15min)
      max: number         // Max requests per window (default: 100)
    }
  }
}
```

#### Stop Server
```javascript
{
  type: 'stop'
}
```

### Worker → Server Messages 

#### Status Updates
```javascript
{
  type: 'status',
  status: 'running' | 'stopped',
  port?: number  // Included only with 'running' status
}
```

#### Error Reporting
```javascript
{
  type: 'error',
  error: string  // Error message
}
```

## Message Flow

1. Server startup:
   - Server sends 'start' message with config
   - Worker responds with 'status' message ('running')

2. Normal operation:
   - Worker sends 'error' messages as needed
   
3. Shutdown:
   - Server sends 'stop' message
   - Worker cleans up and responds with 'status' message ('stopped')
   - Worker terminates

## Error Handling

- All errors from the worker thread are sent via 'error' messages
- Worker continues running after non-fatal errors
- Fatal errors trigger worker termination after error message

# RunCommand Processor Handover

## Purpose & Security Model
RunCommand executes shell commands with security constraints:
- Allowlist of permitted commands
- Blocklist of dangerous patterns
- Configurable timeout
- No shell expansion/interpolation

## Configuration
```javascript
{
  allowedCommands: ['echo', 'ls'], // Whitelist
  blockedPatterns: ['rm', '|', ';'], // Dangerous patterns
  timeout: 5000, // ms before termination
  simples: true // Flag for simple mode
}
```

## Key Files
- `/src/processors/unsafe/RunCommand.js` - Main implementation
- `/src/applications/test_runcommand/` - Test application
- `/tests/unit/RunCommand.spec.js` - Unit tests

## Key Methods
- `validateCommand()` - Security checks
- `executeCommand()` - Executes via child_process.exec
- `initializeSecurity()` - Loads security config
- `process()` - Main processor method

## RDF Representation
```turtle
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .
@prefix t: <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/> .

t:RunCommandConfig a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    rdfs:label "Run command configuration" ;
    trm:allowedCommands ("echo" "ls") ;
    trm:blockedPatterns ("rm" "|" ";") ;
    trm:timeout "5000"^^xsd:integer .
```

## Usage Example
```javascript
const runCommand = new RunCommand({
  allowedCommands: ['echo'],
  timeout: 5000
});

const message = { command: 'echo "Hello"' };
await runCommand.process(message);
```

## Current Status
- Implemented: Basic security, timeout, allowlist/blocklist
- Needed: stdin handling, env vars, working dir config
- Issues: Timeout test reliability

## Critical Points
- Always validate commands before execution
- Never allow shell expansion
- Maintain strict allowlist enforcement
- Handle timeouts gracefully
- Log all command executions

## Recent Changes
1. Added timeout handling
2. Improved security validation
3. Added RDF config support
4. Enhanced error handling

## Known Limitations
- No stdin support
- Limited environment control
- No shell features (pipes, redirects)
- Basic error reporting

# Transmissions Terminology and Conventions

transmission
application
target
payload

Proctor!!! - self-examination functionality (not proctologist)

note surveillance


Transmissions, as an agent, should eat its own dogfood.

Agents have communication skills, agency and intelligence - but the levels of each may be *zero*.

funny
Orchestrator: This word implies a high-level control and direction, which could be fitting for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Director: This word suggests a sense of leadership and guidance, which could work well for a class that manages the construction of an application.
Architect: This word implies a sense of design and planning, which could be fitting for a class that builds an application from scratch.
Builder: This word is straightforward and suggests a sense of construction and creation, which could work well for a class that assembles an application.
Fabricator: This word implies a sense of creation and assembly, which could be fitting for a class that builds an application from a set of instructions.
Constructor: This word is similar to builder, but implies a sense of creation and assembly, which could work well for a class that builds an application.
Compiler: This word implies a sense of taking in instructions and turning them into something executable, which could be fitting for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Interpreter: This word suggests a sense of understanding and executing instructions, which could work well for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Executor: This word implies a sense of taking action and executing instructions, which could be fitting for a class that receives instructions and builds an application.
Proctor: This word suggests a sense of oversight and guidance, which could work well for a class that manages the construction of an application.

I don't know the word proctor - what does it mean in common usage? how might it be applied in the software context?
In common usage, a proctor is typically a person who supervises or monitors an examination, test, or other assessment to ensure its integrity and fairness. For example, a teacher might act as a proctor for a student taking a test, ensuring that the student doesn't cheat or access unauthorized materials.

In the software context, a proctor could be a class or component that oversees and manages the execution of a program or application. Here are a few ways a proctor might be applied:

Test runner: A proctor could be responsible for running tests, ensuring that they are executed correctly, and reporting the results.
Application launcher: A proctor could be used to launch and manage the execution of an application, ensuring that it is started correctly and runs smoothly.
Environment manager: A proctor could be responsible for setting up and managing the environment in which an application runs, such as configuring dependencies, setting variables, or managing resources.
Execution controller: A proctor could be used to control the execution of an application, pausing, resuming, or terminating it as needed.
Monitoring agent: A proctor could be responsible for monitoring the performance and behavior of an application, detecting and reporting any issues or anomalies.
In the context of your framework code, a proctor could be a class that receives instructions and builds an application, and then oversees its execution, testing, and modification. The proctor would ensure that the application is executed correctly, and that any changes or tests are executed in a controlled and predictable manner.

While the word "proctor" might not be immediately familiar in the software context, it's an interesting and unique term that could add a layer of depth and nuance to your framework's architecture.

================
I've been using s/repopack/repomix extensively with Claude Projects. I've found it incredibly useful, many thanks @yamadashy, excellent work! (if you would like praise expressed more formally/for promotional materials, let me know).

The main project 'Transmissions' I'm working on at the moment has LOC & repomix stats as below. I'm predominantly using node, occasional bits of browser stuff (also a toy language 'sheltopusik' I have in-progress, the less said about that the better - hence the instantly forgettable name).
Transmissions is still lacking key features and is neither nor stable nor documented enough for anyone else to have a use for it. But there is some intersection with repomix, in that I'm trying to find a sweetspot for working with LLMs. It's a pipeliney thing with major decoupling, the intention being that any part that needs work on can be comfortably understood in the current size of context windows. This also means I've got a ton of other related projects, each with their own repo, varying sizes.

The repomix config for transmissions isn't far off defaults regarding code, except I do have several additions to the ignore section - like a docs dir that currently includes masses of irrelevant (and redundant) styling stuff. But the (hopefully) useful stuff takes up 55% of the Claude Project knowledge (funny, it was 63% but just now I noticed there was another irrelevant dir - the Top 5 is a great feature!). In addition to this I have a smaller associated repo that notches it up to 73%. This, with a fairly verbose system prompt, seems to push the limits of utility. So trying to connect another project, which may also produce a sizable repomix, with Transmissions was a problem.

My dev workflow for a New Feature (more or less) is figuring out a prompt describing my requirements for it, repomixing (good verb) and replacing the project's current knowledge, starting a new chat session in the project. This I follow for maybe a dozen interactions, 6 or so artifacts, then halt, however prematurely, and ask for a handover document (I have a bunch of commands in the system prompt, ho gives me a summary as an artifact, including metadata in RDF/Turtle). Even being careful, with the Big Knowledge, I often hit the token limit. Claudio gets another walk.
Something I've found useful when working with the other project as the main context, but still wishing Claude to have knowledge of Transmissions for integration purposes, is to have this in my package.json :

{
...
  "scripts": {
    "rp": "repomix -c repomix.config-small.json . && repomix -c repomix.config-large.json . ",
   ...
   }
}
repomix.config-small.json has a lot more in the ignore section, stripping things back to a bare minimum, used in auxiliary projects. repomix.config-large.json has everything relevant, used in 'transmissions' itself.

(I'm leaving it as legacy rp, I'm all-Linux here rm is rarely wise :)

fyi @yamadashy, I plan to use chunks of repomix, pulled apart into small pieces, in my Transmissions pipeliney thing. I've not actually looked yet how things are exposed, but ideally I'd like to use it as a lib, so one node on my processing pipeline loads the config, another build the path filters, aother does the treewalking etc etc.

Whatever, thanks again, keep up the good work!

Repomix is a powerful tool that packs your entire repository into a single, AI-friendly file.  
It is perfect for when you need to feed your codebase to Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.
> [!NOTE]
> Due to legal considerations, this project has been renamed from "Repopack" to "Repomix". Only the name is changing; Repomix all functionality and maintainer ([@yamadashy](https://github.com/yamadashy)) remain the same.
> For detailed information about this transition and migration guide, please visit our [Discussion](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/discussions/188).

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Optimized**: Formats your codebase in a way that's easy for AI to understand and process.
- **Token Counting**: Provides token counts for each file and the entire repository, useful for LLM context limits.
- **Simple to Use**: You need just one command to pack your entire repository.
- **Customizable**: Easily configure what to include or exclude.
- **Git-Aware**: Automatically respects your .gitignore files.
- **Security-Focused**: Incorporates [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) for robust security checks to detect and prevent inclusion of sensitive information.



## 🚀 Quick Start

You can try Repomix instantly in your project directory without installation:

```bash
npx repomix

### Output File Format

Repomix generates a single file with clear separators between different parts of your codebase.  
To enhance AI comprehension, the output file begins with an AI-oriented explanation, making it easier for AI models to understand the context and structure of the packed repository.

#### Plain Text Format (default)

```text
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

================================================================
File Summary
================================================================
(Metadata and usage AI instructions)

================================================================
Repository Structure
================================================================
src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts

(...remaining directories)

================================================================
Repository Files
================================================================

================
File: src/index.js
================
// File contents here

================
File: src/utils.js
================
// File contents here

(...remaining files)

================================================================
Instruction
================================================================
(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)
```

#### XML Format

To generate output in XML format, use the `--style xml` option:
```bash
repomix --style xml
```

The XML format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:

```xml
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

<file_summary>
(Metadata and usage AI instructions)
</file_summary>

<repository_structure>
src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts

(...remaining directories)
</repository_structure>

<repository_files>
<file path="src/index.js">
// File contents here
</file>

(...remaining files)
</repository_files>

<instruction>
(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)
</instruction>
```

For those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:  
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags

> When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

This means that the XML output from Repomix is not just a different format, but potentially a more effective way to feed your codebase into AI systems for analysis, code review, or other tasks.

#### Markdown Format

To generate output in Markdown format, use the `--style markdown` option:
```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

The Markdown format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:

````markdown
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

# File Summary
(Metadata and usage AI instructions)

# Repository Structure
```
src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
```
(...remaining directories)

# Repository Files

## File: src/index.js
```
// File contents here
```

(...remaining files)

# Instruction
(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)
````

This format provides a clean, readable structure that is both human-friendly and easily parseable by AI systems.

### Command Line Options

- `-v, --version`: Show tool version
- `-o, --output <file>`: Specify the output file name
- `--include <patterns>`: List of include patterns (comma-separated)
- `-i, --ignore <patterns>`: Additional ignore patterns (comma-separated)
- `-c, --config <path>`: Path to a custom config file
- `--style <style>`: Specify the output style (`plain`, `xml`, `markdown`)
- `--top-files-len <number>`: Number of top files to display in the summary
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Show line numbers in the output
- `--copy`: Additionally copy generated output to system clipboard
- `--remote <url>`: Process a remote Git repository
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging

Examples:
```bash
repomix -o custom-output.txt
repomix -i "*.log,tmp" -v
repomix -c ./custom-config.json
repomix --style xml
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo.git
npx repomix src
```

### Updating Repomix

To update a globally installed Repomix:

```bash
# Using npm
npm update -g repomix

# Using yarn
yarn global upgrade repomix
```

Using `npx repomix` is generally more convenient as it always uses the latest version.


### Remote Repository Processing

Repomix supports processing remote Git repositories without the need for manual cloning. This feature allows you to quickly analyze any public Git repository with a single command.

To process a remote repository, use the `--remote` option followed by the repository URL:

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

You can also use GitHub's shorthand format:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo
```


## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `repomix.config.json` file in your project root for custom configurations.
```bash
repomix --init
```

Here's an explanation of the configuration options:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
|`output.filePath`| The name of the output file | `"repomix-output.txt"` |
|`output.style`| The style of the output (`plain`, `xml`, `markdown`) |`"plain"`|
|`output.headerText`| Custom text to include in the file header |`null`|
|`output.instructionFilePath`| Path to a file containing detailed custom instructions |`null`|
|`output.removeComments`| Whether to remove comments from supported file types | `false` |
|`output.removeEmptyLines`| Whether to remove empty lines from the output | `false` |
|`output.showLineNumbers`| Whether to add line numbers to each line in the output |`false`|
|`output.copyToClipboard`| Whether to copy the output to system clipboard in addition to saving the file |`false`|
|`output.topFilesLength`| Number of top files to display in the summary. If set to 0, no summary will be displayed |`5`|
|`output.includeEmptyDirectories`| Whether to include empty directories in the repository structure |`false`|
|`include`| Patterns of files to include (using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)) |`[]`|
|`ignore.useGitignore`| Whether to use patterns from the project's `.gitignore` file |`true`|
|`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`| Whether to use default ignore patterns |`true`|
|`ignore.customPatterns`| Additional patterns to ignore (using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)) |`[]`|
|`security.enableSecurityCheck`| Whether to perform security checks on files |`true`|

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "headerText": "Custom header information for the packed file.",
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "copyToClipboard": true,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    "customPatterns": ["additional-folder", "**/*.log"]
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  }
}
```

### Global Configuration
To create a global configuration file:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

The global configuration file will be created in:
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json`
- macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/repomix/repomix.config.json` or `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json`

Note: Local configuration (if present) takes precedence over global configuration.

### Include and Ignore
#### Include Patterns
Repomix now supports specifying files to include using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). This allows for more flexible and powerful file selection:

- Use `**/*.js` to include all JavaScript files in any directory
- Use `src/**/*` to include all files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories
- Combine multiple patterns like `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` to include JavaScript files in `src` and all Markdown files

#### Ignore Patterns
Repomix offers multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing process:

- **.gitignore**: By default, patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` file are used. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useGitignore` setting.
- **Default patterns**: Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., node_modules, .git, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` setting. Please see [defaultIgnore.ts](src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) for more details.
- **.repomixignore**: You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.
- **Custom patterns**: Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.customPatterns` option in the configuration file. You can overwrite this setting with the `-i, --ignore` command line option.

Priority Order (from highest to lowest):
1. Custom patterns `ignore.customPatterns`
2. `.repomixignore`
3. `.gitignore` (if `ignore.useGitignore` is true)
4. Default patterns (if `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true)

This approach allows for flexible file exclusion configuration based on your project's needs. It helps optimize the size of the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while preventing the leakage of confidential information.

Note: Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the "Repository Structure" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the packed file efficient and text-based.

### Custom Instruction

The `output.instructionFilePath` option allows you to specify a separate file containing detailed instructions or context about your project. This allows AI systems to understand the specific context and requirements of your project, potentially leading to more relevant and tailored analysis or suggestions.

Here's an example of how you might use this feature:

1. Create a file named `repomix-instruction.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# Coding Guidelines
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Suggest splitting files into smaller, focused units when appropriate
- Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep all text in English
- All new features should have corresponding unit tests

# Generate Comprehensive Output
- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise
- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality
```

2. In your `repomix.config.json`, add the `instructionFilePath` option:

```json5
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

When Repomix generates the output, it will include the contents of `repomix-instruction.md` in a dedicated section.

Note: The instruction content is appended at the end of the output file. This placement can be particularly effective for AI systems. For those interested in understanding why this might be beneficial, Anthropic provides some insights in their documentation:  
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips

> Put long-form data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.
> Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.

### Comment Removal

When `output.removeComments` is set to `true`, Repomix will attempt to remove comments from supported file types. This feature can help reduce the size of the output file and focus on the essential code content.

Supported languages include:  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C#, Java, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Shell, and YAML.

Note: The comment removal process is conservative to avoid accidentally removing code. In complex cases, some comments might be retained.



## 🔍 Security Check

Repomix includes a security check feature that uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect potentially sensitive information in your files. This feature helps you identify possible security risks before sharing your packed repository.

The security check results will be displayed in the CLI output after the packing process is complete. If any suspicious files are detected, you'll see a list of these files along with a warning message.

Example output:

```
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected:
1. src/utils/test.txt
2. tests/utils/secretLintUtils.test.ts

Please review these files for potentially sensitive information.
```

By default, Repomix's security check feature is enabled. You can disable it by setting `security.enableSecurityCheck` to `false` in your configuration file:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

# ComfyUI Integration Handover

## Architecture Delta
- ComfyUI uses GPU-optimized async node execution vs Transmissions' single-threaded EventEmitter pipeline
- Node configs in ComfyUI are JSON-based vs RDF/Turtle in Transmissions
- ComfyUI graph is non-linear with conditional execution vs sequential Transmission pipes

## Key Integration Points

### Message Adapters
```javascript
// Create bidirectional adapters between systems
class ComfyMessage extends ProcessProcessor {
  async process(message) {
    return {
      data: message.content,
      metadata: message.config
    }
  }
}
```

### Resource Management
- ComfyUI nodes manage GPU tensors
- Require cleanup hooks in Processor subclasses
- Use WorkerPool.js pattern for async node execution

### Graph Translation
```turtle
# ComfyUI node becomes
:node1 a :KSampler ;
    trm:config :samplerConfig .
```

## Integration Steps
1. Create adapter processors for message translation
2. Add parallel execution support to TransmissionRunner
3. Implement resource cleanup in Processor base class
4. Build graph format converter utility

## Review Points
- Monitor memory usage during cross-system messaging
- Test GPU resource allocation/cleanup
- Validate graph translation edge cases

# ComfyUI to Transmissions Integration Notes

## Key Architecture Differences

1. Workflow Definition
- ComfyUI: JSON graph with explicit node connections
- Transmissions: RDF pipeline definitions in Turtle format
  ```turtle
  :pipeline a trm:Pipeline ;
      trm:pipe (:step1 :step2) .
  ```

2. Message Flow
- ComfyUI: Asynchronous node execution based on input availability
- Transmissions: Sequential EventEmitter-based pipeline with structured messages

3. Execution Model  
- ComfyUI: Parallel GPU-optimized execution
- Transmissions: Single-threaded processor chain

## Integration Points

1. Workflow Mapping
- Each ComfyUI node maps to a Transmissions Processor
- Node connections become Connector instances
- Node configs map to processor-config.ttl entries

2. Message Translation
```javascript
// ComfyUI node output
{data: tensor, metadata: {...}}

// Needs conversion to Transmissions format
{content: buffer, type: 'image/tensor'}
```

3. Key Files
- src/engine/Transmission.js - Core pipeline execution
- src/engine/Connector.js - Message passing
- src/processors/base/Processor.js - Base processor class

## Next Steps

1. Create adapter classes for translating between message formats
2. Implement parallel execution in Transmission.js
3. Add GPU resource management
4. Create workflow format converter

Note: Pay special attention to cleanup and resource handling when bridging between the two execution models.

The long term plan is to facilitate interoperability between Transmissions and ComfyUI. The first phase will be to use the ComfyUI editor to create and run transmissions following the RDF Turtle model. Within transmissions some kind of interface should be added to make its processors more compatible with ComfyUI nodes. Custom nodes will be needed for ComfyUI to act as adaptors between the two message systems and to allow transmissions to be run from within ComfyUI. Figure out a step-by-step plan on how all this might be achieved, and then for each step give implementation details.

---

Key points for the integration:

Keep the RDF/Turtle foundation of Transmissions while adopting ComfyUI's execution model
Use eye reasoner for workflow validation and optimization
Implement proper GPU resource management
Create adapters between the two message systems
q1: Should the graph execution engine be built from scratch or adapted from ComfyUI's implementation?

q2: What's the best approach to handle tensor lifecycle management between the two systems?

q3: How should workflow validation rules be expressed in RDF/Turtle?

q4: Should the integration target ComfyUI compatibility or a new hybrid architecture?

# Transmissions Architecture

**Provisional - this needs cycling through implementation**

* #:link trm.ttl - vocab
* #:link trm.md - namespace doc


Transmissions is a quasi-functional data processing framework with a hierarchical composite structure. The unit of data is the #:t:message. Messages are expressed as JSON objects, but it should be noted that eg. `message.dataset` is an RDF payload, the contents of which is open-ended.


## Message Schema

 #:todo JSON schema

 move system-level bits (currently just paths) into their own block

 `message.dataset` is a bit overloaded, need `message.manifest` as the core one

What different ways of creating instances of classes in node js, including the esoteric ones?
ChatGPT
Creating instances of classes in Node.js primarily revolves around using the `new` operator with constructor functions or class definitions. However, there are several techniques, including some less commonly used (or esoteric) methods, to instantiate objects. Here's an overview:

### 1. Standard Instantiation with `new`

The most common method involves defining a class or constructor function and using the `new` keyword to create instances.

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const instance = new MyClass("Example");
```

### 2. Factory Functions

Factory functions return a new object and can encapsulate the use of `new` internally or return object literals directly.

```javascript
function createInstance(name) {
  return new MyClass(name);
}
const instance = createInstance("Example");
```

### 3. Object.create()

`Object.create(proto[, propertiesObject])` creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

```javascript
const prototype = {
  sayName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};
const instance = Object.create(prototype);
instance.name = "Example";
```

### 4. Calling Constructor without `new` (Esoteric)

Using the constructor directly without `new` is not standard for creating instances and usually results in errors or unexpected behavior. However, some constructors might internally manage instantiation to allow this.

```javascript
function MyClass(name) {
  if (!(this instanceof MyClass)) {
    return new MyClass(name);
  }
  this.name = name;
}

const instance = MyClass("Example"); // Works due to internal handling
```

### 5. Clone Existing Instance

Creating a new instance by cloning an existing one, although not creating a fresh instance in the strictest sense, serves to produce a new object.

```javascript
const original = new MyClass("Original");
const clone = Object.assign(
  Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(original)),
  original
);
```

### 6. Deserialization

Creating an instance from a string representation, typically used in conjunction with serialization.

```javascript
const serialized = '{"name":"Example"}'; // Could be the result of JSON.stringify(instance)
const instance = Object.assign(new MyClass(), JSON.parse(serialized));
```

### 7. Function.prototype.bind()

You can set the `this` value in the constructor function, allowing for partial application or setting certain initial parameters ahead of time.

```javascript
function MyClass(name, message) {
  this.name = name;
  this.message = message;
}

const PreConfigured = MyClass.bind(null, "PreConfiguredName");
const instance = new PreConfigured("Hello World");
```

### 8. Proxy for Constructor (Esoteric)

Using a `Proxy` to intercept and customize the instantiation process.

```javascript
const MyClassProxy = new Proxy(MyClass, {
  construct(target, args) {
    console.log("MyClass instantiated with args:", args);
    return new target(...args);
  },
});

const instance = new MyClassProxy("Example");
```

These methods showcase the flexibility of object creation in JavaScript and Node.js, ranging from straightforward and common practices to more unusual and esoteric approaches. Each has its use cases, depending on the requirements for flexibility, pattern use, and object initialization specifics.
User
If all the object needs is a distinct name 'MyClass', the ability to set the value of a property 'config' in a constructor-like function where properties will be set, and a function process(data) which returns a processed version of data, what is the minimum code necessary? Could these objects be create with something like a const instance = create('MyName') kind of function?
ChatGPT
For a minimal implementation that meets the specified requirements, you can use a factory function to create instances. Each instance needs a distinct name (`MyClass`), the ability to set the value of a `config` property in a constructor-like function, and an `execute(data)` method that returns a processed version of the data. Here's a concise way to accomplish this:

```javascript
function createInstance(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    config: null,
    process(data) {
      // Process and return the data
      // This example simply returns the data as-is; replace with actual processing logic
      return data;
    },
    setConfig(config) {
      this.config = config;
    },
  };
}

// Example usage:
const instance = createInstance("MyName");
instance.setConfig({ key: "value" }); // Setting the config
console.log(instance.process("some data")); // Executing and processing data
```

This approach uses a simple object literal inside the `createInstance` factory function to define the necessary properties and methods. Each created instance will have its own `name`, `config`, and `execute` method, as per the requirements.

- `name` is assigned based on the argument passed to `createInstance`.
- `config` can be set using the `setConfig` method, which simulates constructor-like behavior for setting initial properties.
- `execute(data)` method is defined to process and return data. You can replace the placeholder logic with actual data processing as needed.

This solution provides a lightweight and flexible way to create instances with the desired functionality, following your example of a `create('MyName')` style function call.
User
Could the execute function be created from a string?
ChatGPT
Yes, the `execute` function can be created from a string using the `new Function()` constructor. This method allows you to dynamically create a function from a string of JavaScript code. Here's how you could modify the previous example to include an `execute` function created from a string:

```javascript
function createInstance(name, executeFunctionString) {
  return {
    name: name,
    config: null,
    execute: new Function("data", executeFunctionString),
    setConfig(config) {
      this.config = config;
    },
  };
}

// Example usage:
const executeCode = 'return data + " processed";'; // String of code for the execute function
const instance = createInstance("MyName", executeCode);
instance.setConfig({ key: "value" }); // Setting the config

console.log(instance.process("some data")); // Outputs: "some data processed"
```

In this example, the `executeFunctionString` parameter is passed to `new Function('data', executeFunctionString)`, where `'data'` is the name of the argument that the function will receive, and `executeFunctionString` is the body of the function. This dynamically created function is then assigned to the `execute` property of the object returned by `createInstance`.

**Note of Caution:** Using `new Function()` to create functions from strings poses similar risks to `eval()` in terms of security and performance:

- **Security Risk:** If the string is derived from user input or an untrusted source, it could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, such as code injection attacks.
- **Debugging Difficulty:** Debugging can be more challenging because the dynamically generated code may not be as readily traceable in debugging tools.
- **Performance:** The JavaScript engine can't optimize these functions as well as it can for statically declared functions.

Always validate and sanitize any input if you choose to use this approach, and consider whether the dynamic nature of function creation is necessary for your use case.
User
In RS6, can imports be done inside functions?
ChatGPT
In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), the standard import syntax (`import ... from '...'`) cannot be used conditionally or inside functions, blocks, or any other statements that are not at the top level of a module. The ES6 `import` statements are static and must be at the top level of your JavaScript file or module, allowing for these imports to be statically analyzed by JavaScript engines and bundlers.

However, you can dynamically import modules using the `import()` function, which returns a promise. This feature is not part of ES6, but it was added later in the ES2020 (ECMAScript 11) specification. The `import()` function can be used inside functions, conditionals, loops, or anywhere you can execute a function. It is useful for lazy-loading modules only when they are needed, which can improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial load time.

Here's an example of how to use dynamic imports within a function:

```javascript
async function loadModuleDynamically() {
  const moduleName = "./myModule.js"; // The module path
  const module = await import(moduleName);
  module.myFunction(); // Use a function from the imported module
}

loadModuleDynamically().then(() => {
  console.log("Module loaded and function executed");
});
```

In this example, `import(moduleName)` dynamically imports the module specified by `moduleName`, and because `import()` returns a promise, you can use `await` within an async function to wait for the module to be loaded before using it.

This approach provides flexibility for loading modules based on conditions, user actions, or any logic that requires modules to be loaded dynamically at runtime.
User
How could you check at runtime to see if import() was supported?
ChatGPT
To check at runtime whether dynamic `import()` is supported, you can use a feature detection approach. This involves attempting to use `import()` with a data URI or a no-op (no operation) module and catching any errors if the feature is not supported. Since `import()` returns a promise, you can use a try-catch block within an asynchronous function to perform this check. Here's how you could implement it:

```javascript
async function supportsDynamicImport() {
  try {
    // Attempt to dynamically import a module using a no-op or data URI
    // For actual deployment, a more reliable check with a real module path may be preferable
    await new Function('return import("data:text/javascript;base64,Cg==")')();
    return true; // Dynamic import is supported
  } catch (error) {
    return false; // Dynamic import is not supported
  }
}

// Example usage
supportsDynamicImport().then((isSupported) => {
  if (isSupported) {
    console.log("Dynamic import is supported");
  } else {
    console.log("Dynamic import is not supported");
  }
});
```

This function works by dynamically creating a function that attempts to `import` a base64-encoded empty JavaScript module. If the browser or environment supports dynamic imports, this operation will succeed, and the function will return `true`. If not, the operation will throw an exception, and the function will return `false`.

Note: The use of `new Function()` allows this check to not cause a syntax error in environments that do not recognize `import()` syntax at all, as the `import()` call is within a string and not directly in the JavaScript code being parsed.

This method provides a straightforward way to determine the availability of dynamic imports, allowing you to conditionally implement fallback logic or alternative module loading strategies if necessary.
User
Can imports go in eval() strings?
ChatGPT
Using `import` statements directly within `eval()` strings in JavaScript does not work in the same way as using them at the top level of modules or through dynamic `import()` expressions. The static `import` statement is part of the module syntax and expected to be statically analyzable at the top level of module files, not dynamically executed within function bodies, `eval()`, or similar constructs.

However, dynamic imports using `import()` can be used within `eval()` because `import()` is a function that returns a promise. This allows for dynamically importing modules even in messages where static import statements are not syntactically valid. Here's an example:

```javascript
eval('import("./module.js").then(module => { console.log(module); })');
```

This uses `eval()` to dynamically execute a string that contains a dynamic import statement. Note that this approach does indeed work, but it combines two powerful and potentially risky features of JavaScript: `eval()` and dynamic imports. Both should be used cautiously because:

- `eval()` can execute arbitrary code, which poses significant security risks, especially with untrusted input. It's also generally slower and harder to debug compared to other methods of executing JavaScript.
- Dynamic imports can introduce complexity to your module loading strategy and potentially impact performance negatively if not used judyiciously.

Given these considerations, while you can use dynamic `import()` within `eval()` strings, it's essential to carefully assess whether this approach is necessary and ensure that the code being evaluated is from a trusted source to avoid security vulnerabilities.

Repairing/refactoring #:postcraft

In #:transmissions I have to be clearer about where processors get their instructions. I think this is what it should be, in descending order :

Properties in the :

1. `message` they receive
2. target `manifest.ttl`
3. application `config.ttl`
4. *sensible default TBD*

Right now I need it in `DirWalker`. It appears I've used `message.sourceDir` there before. Not ideal naming, but I get why - "sourceDir" will make sense in lots of other processors.


```javascript
import path from 'path'
import ns from '../../utils/ns.js'
...

var templateFilename = this.getProperty(ns.trm.templateFilename)
```

need to check :
```
"targetPath": "/home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/test-site",
```

for future ref, this is the funny replace I needed in `DirWalker` to get a subdirectory :
```javascript
      message.subdir = path.dirname(path.relative(message.targetPath, fullPath)).split(path.sep)[1];

# Re-Rendering Claude Chat JSON Data

I'm using Claude's Projects a *lot*, and have been attempting to keep projects distinct. But I hop around between them, and leave many threads in-progress, it's got very difficult to find things. But a JSON export is available.

What I'd like is `converstations.json` rendered on the fs something like :

```
> ROOT
  meta_r.ttl
    > PROJECT1
      meta_p1.ttl
      > SESSION1
        meta_s1.ttl
        text1.md
        text2.md
        ...
      > SESSION2
        ...
    > PROJECT2
   ...
```

*I started building the #:transmission for these as an application away from the core [transmissions repo](https://github.com/danja/transmissions), over in [trans-apps](https://github.com/danja/trans-apps). But got in a tangle with paths in `ModuleLoader`, so reverted to putting it in the core for now. One problem at a time...*

Last night I got the #:transmission this far (very hackily) :
```turtle
:cjc a trm:Pipeline ;

trm:pipe (:p10 :p30 :p40) .

:p10 a :JSONWalker .
:p20 a :Unfork .
:p30 a :MarkdownFormatter .
:p40 a :FileWriter .
```
This is run from:
```sh
./trans claude-json-converter -P ./conversations.json
```

`JSONWalker` runs through the list of top level elements, spawning a new pipe for each. I had `Unfork` in there so I could look at one in isolation. So far so good. But I now need it to split each of these. `JSONWalker` again (it's only going to handle one layer, maybe rename..?). But different config. Right now all that's hardcoded, it should go in `processors-config.ttl`.

Hmm, first the target *ROOT* dir. That should already be doable from the CLI:
```sh
./trans claude-json-converter -P ./conversations.json target_root
```
to check (`:SM` = Show Message) :
```turtle
:cjc_test a trm:Pipeline ;
trm:pipe (:SM ) .
```

Boo! The message includes :
```
"dataDir": "src/applications/claude-json-converter/data",
"rootDir": "target_dir",
"applicationRootDir": "target_dir",
```
Messed up from my module-loading efforts. Ok, for now I'll put it in `processors-config.ttl`.
```turtle
t:TopConfig a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:key t:topConfig ;
    trm:targetDir "claude-chat" .
```

for:
```turtle
:p10 a :JSONWalker ;
     trm:configKey :topConfig .
```

So, `ShowConfig`:
```turtle
:cjc_test a trm:Pipeline ;
trm:pipe (:SC) .
```

Hah! Fool danny. I'd completely forgotten how I'd set up access to the config. Even then it's very *work-in-progress*. But this worked well enough for now :
```javascript
logger.debug(`JSONWalker: using configKey ${this.configKey.value}`)
const targetDir = this.getPropertyFromMyConfig(ns.trm.targetDir)
logger.debug(`JSONWalker:targetDir =  ${targetDir}`)
```

Next, how does `FileWriter` work..?

# Testes

I've got a couple of new integration tests in place using Jasmine, but realised I haven't got any facility for checking test coverage. A quick google led me to : [Jasmine Unit Tests Setup with Code Coverage for Node JS](https://medium.com/@karthiknom/jasmine-unit-tests-setup-with-code-coverage-for-node-js-5ff0d1b2781e) which uses [Istanbul Code Coverage](https://github.com/istanbuljs) via its  command line interface [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)
"nyc": {
  "report-dir": "spec/coverage",
  "exclude": [
    "spec/**/*"
  ]

The user has provided the environment details of their current working directory, which is `/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions`. The directory contains various files and subdirectories related to a project named `transmissions`. The user seems to be working on a project that involves processing and managing files, possibly related to web development or data processing. The project includes directories for applications, core components, processors, and tests.

To proceed, I need to understand the user's task. The user has not specified a task yet. I will ask the user to clarify what they need help with.

[ask_followup_question for 'What specific task do you need help with regarding your `transmissions` project?'] Result:
<answer>
Your task is to fix this : Transmissions applications should be able to load modules from remote locations.

The transmission defined in `trans-apps/applications/module-load-test/transmissions.ttl` should first load the processors and configurations it needs and then run the pipeline.
The transmission first should read :
`trans-apps/applications/module-load-test/manifest.ttl`
Then it should apply the values passed in the message to an instance of `Concat'.

Here the values are passed from the command line :

Running from `~/github-danny/transmissions` :

```sh
./trans ../trans-apps/applications/module-load-test -m {"first":"one","second":"two"}
```

But this fails right away :

```sh
+ ***** Execute Transmission :  <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/module_load_test>
| Running : http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/p10 a DatasetReader
[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'second:two/manifest.ttl'] {
  errno: -2,

**Assistant:**

Based on the user's response, the task is to enable the `transmissions` application to load modules from remote locations. Specifically, the application should be able to read a manifest file from a URL passed in the command line arguments and use the values from this manifest to configure an instance of the `Concat` processor.

The user has provided the following files:
- `../trans-apps/applications/module-load-test/about.md` (not relevant for the task)
- `src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js` (not relevant for the task)
- `../trans-apps/applications/module-load-test/transmissions.ttl` (the transmission definition)
- `../trans-apps/applications/module-load-test/processors/Concat.js` (the processor to be configured)
- `../trans-applications/applications/module-load-test/manifest.ttl` (the manifest file)

The user has also mentioned that the application fails to open the manifest file when running the transmission with the command:
```sh
./trans ../trans-apps/applications/module-load-test -m {"first":"one","second":"two"}
```
The error message indicates that the file `second:two/manifest.ttl` does not exist, which is incorrect since the manifest file is located at `../trans-applications/applications/module-load-test/manifest.ttl`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `TransmissionBuilder` correctly handles the manifest file path and loads the manifest file from the correct location. The manifest file should be loaded from the URL passed in the command line arguments.

Let's first check the `TransmissionBuilder.js` file to see how the manifest file is being handled. We will use the `read_file` tool to read the content of the `TransmissionBuilder.js` file.

<path>src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js</path>

**Assistant:**

The `TransmissionBuilder.js` file contains the `TransmissionBuilder` class, which is responsible for building transmissions based on the provided configuration. The class has methods for reading datasets, constructing transmissions, creating nodes, connecting nodes, and creating processors.

The issue seems to be related to how the manifest file path is handled. The manifest file is expected to be loaded from the URL passed in the command line arguments, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the path.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `TransmissionBuilder` class to ensure that the manifest file is loaded from the correct location. We will need to update the `buildTransmissions` method to correctly handle the manifest file path.

Let's first check the `buildTransmissions` method to see how the manifest file is being handled. We will use the `read_file` tool to read the content of the `buildTransmissions` method.

<read_file>
<path>src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js</path>
<regex>buildTransmissions</regex>
</read_file>

**Assistant:**

The `TransmissionBuilder` class in the `TransmissionBuilder.js` file has a method `buildTransmissions` that constructs transmissions based on the provided configuration. The issue seems to be related to how the manifest file path is handled. The current implementation does not correctly handle the path passed as a command-line argument.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `buildTransmissions` method to ensure that the manifest file is loaded from the correct location. We will need to update the method to correctly handle the manifest file path passed as an argument.

Let's first check the `buildTransmissions` method to see how the manifest file is being handled. We will use the `read_file` tool to read the content of the `buildTransmissions` method.

<path>src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js</path>

**Assistant:**

The `buildTransmissions` method in the `TransmissionBuilder` class is currently using the `transmissionConfigFile` and `processorsConfigFile` parameters to read datasets from the provided paths. However, the method does not correctly handle the paths passed as arguments. The paths are not being used to load the datasets, and instead, the method is trying to load the datasets from the current working directory.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `buildTransmissions` method to correctly load the datasets from the paths passed as arguments. We will use the `read_file` tool to read the content of the `buildTransmissions` method and then modify it accordingly.

**Assistant:**

The `TransmissionBuilder` class in the provided code has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `buildTransmissions` method is missing the `await` keyword before the `this.constructTransmission` call, which is causing an asynchronous function to be called synchronously. This needs to be fixed to ensure that the function is awaited properly.

2. The `createNodes` method is also missing the `await` keyword before the `this.createProcessor` call, which is causing the same issue as above.

3. The `createProcessor` method is not being awaited, which could lead to issues if the asynchronous loading of the processor module fails.

4. The `createProcessor` method is using the `AbstractProcessorFactory` to create processors, but it's not being awaited, which could lead to issues if the asynchronous loading of the processor module fails.

5. The `createProcessor` method is trying to load processors from the `transmission.ttl` file, but it's not being awaited, which could lead to issues if the asynchronous loading of the processor module fails.

To fix these issues, we need to add the `await` keyword before the asynchronous calls in the `createNodes` and `createProcessor` methods, and ensure that the `createProcessor` method is awaited properly.

Let's modify the code accordingly:

```javascript
class TransmissionBuilder {

  // ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)

  async buildTransmissions(transmissionConfig, processorsConfig) {
    const poi = grapoi({ dataset: transmissionConfig })

        const pipelineID = q.subject
        //    transmissions.push(await this.constructTransmission(transmissionConfig, pipelineID, processorsConfig));
        transmissions.push(await this.constructTransmission(transmissionConfig, pipelineID, processorsConfig)) // was await
      }
    }
    return transmissions

}

```

Now, the `TransmissionBuilder` class should be fixed, and the asynchronous calls should be handled correctly.

# Transmissions Codebase Reorganization Plan

## Phase 1: Create New Core Classes

1. Create `src/core/Director.js`:
```javascript
class Director {
  constructor() {
    this.builder = new TransmissionBuilder();
    this.runner = new TransmissionRunner();
    this.procurer = new Procurer();
    this.proctor = new Proctor();
  }

  async initializeApplication(args) {
    const application = new Application();
    await this.procurer.loadResources(application, args);
    await this.builder.buildTransmissions(application);
    return application;
  }

  async applyToTarget(application, target) {
    await this.runner.execute(application, target);
  }
}
```

2. Create `src/core/Application.js`:
```javascript
class Application {
  constructor() {
    this.transmissions = new Map();
    this.config = null;
    this.manifest = null;
  }

  addTransmission(id, transmission) {
    this.transmissions.set(id, transmission);
  }
}
```

3. Create `src/core/Procurer.js`:
```javascript
class Procurer {
  constructor() {
    this.moduleLoader = ModuleLoaderFactory.createModuleLoader();
  }

  async loadResources(application, args) {
    const config = await this.loadConfig(args.configPath);
    const manifest = await this.loadManifest(args.target);
    application.config = config;
    application.manifest = manifest;
  }
}
```

## Phase 2: Refactor Existing Code

1. Rename and update `CommandUtils.js` to `Dispatch.js`:
```javascript
class Dispatch {
  constructor() {
    this.director = new Director();
  }

  async handleCommand(args) {
    const application = await this.director.initializeApplication(args);
    await this.director.applyToTarget(application, args.target);
  }
}
```

2. Update `run.js`:
```javascript
import Dispatch from './src/core/Dispatch.js';

const dispatch = new Dispatch();
await dispatch.handleCommand(args);
```

## Phase 3: Move Functionality

1. Move module loading from TransmissionBuilder to Procurer:
```javascript
// In Procurer.js
async loadModule(name) {
  return this.moduleLoader.loadModule(name);
}
```

2. Move dataset operations from TransmissionBuilder to Procurer:
```javascript
// In Procurer.js
async loadDataset(path) {
  const stream = fromFile(path);
  return await rdf.dataset().import(stream);
}
```

## Phase 4: Implement Resource Resolution

1. Add resource resolution to Procurer:
```javascript
// In Procurer.js
async resolveTransmissionFiles(basePath) {
  const files = await this.findTransmissionFiles(basePath);
  return this.mergeTransmissionFiles(files);
}

async resolveConfigFiles(basePath) {
  const files = await this.findConfigFiles(basePath);
  return this.mergeConfigFiles(files);
}
```

## Migration Steps

1. Create new directory structure:
```
src/
  core/
    Director.js
    Application.js
    Procurer.js
    Proctor.js
    Dispatch.js
  engine/  # Move existing engine code here
  processors/ # Keep existing processors here
```

2. Update imports in all files to reflect new structure

3. Create placeholder Proctor:
```javascript
class Proctor {
  constructor() {
    // Placeholder for future implementation
  }
}
```

4. Update tests to use new structure

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for new core classes
2. Update existing integration tests
3. Add new integration tests for multi-file transmissions
4. Verify resource resolution with test cases

# Transmissions Refactoring Handover Document

## Project Summary
Reorganizing the Transmissions codebase to improve separation of concerns and extensibility. The key change is introduction of a Director pattern to manage Application lifecycles and resource procurement.

## Core Architecture Changes

### New Core Components

1. **Director**
- Central orchestrator for application lifecycle
- Manages TransmissionBuilder, TransmissionRunner, Procurer, Proctor
- Entry point for all application operations

2. **Application**
- Container for Transmission definitions
- Holds configuration and manifest data
- Manages transmission relationships

3. **Procurer**
- Handles all resource loading and resolution
- Manages module dependencies
- RDF data operations for config/manifest files

4. **Proctor** (placeholder)
- Future home for reflection/testing/documentation

### Key Changes

1. **Command Processing**
- `CommandUtils` → `Dispatch`
- Simplified to delegate to Director
- Cleaner separation of CLI concerns

2. **Resource Management**
- Module loading moved from TransmissionBuilder to Procurer
- Dataset operations centralized in Procurer
- Support for multiple transmission/config files

## Implementation State

### Completed
- Basic architecture design
- Component interface definitions
- Migration plan

### Pending
- Implementation of core classes
- Migration of existing functionality
- Test suite updates
- Resource resolution implementation

## Key Files & Locations

```
src/
  core/
    Director.js         # New orchestration layer
    Application.js      # New application container
    Procurer.js         # New resource manager  
    Proctor.js         # Future testing/docs framework
    Dispatch.js         # Renamed from CommandUtils
  engine/              # Existing engine code
  processors/          # Existing processors
```

## Migration Tasks

1. Core Implementation
- Create new core/ directory structure
- Implement Director, Application classes
- Create Procurer with basic functionality
- Add Proctor placeholder

2. Code Migration
- Move module loading to Procurer
- Move dataset operations to Procurer
- Update import paths throughout codebase

3. Testing
- Create unit tests for new components
- Update existing integration tests
- Add multi-file transmission tests

## Critical Paths

1. Resource Resolution
- Parse transmissions.ttl for external references
- Merge multiple transmission definitions
- Handle circular dependencies

2. Application State
- Clear lifecycle stages for Application
- Clean state management in Director
- Error handling/recovery

# Priorities

Repairing/refactoring #:postcraft

In #:transmissions I have to be clearer about where processors get their instructions. I think this is what it should be, in descending order :

Properties in the :

1. `message` they receive
2. target `manifest.ttl`
3. application `config.ttl`
4. *sensible default TBD*

Right now I need it in `DirWalker`. It appears I've used `message.sourceDir` there before. Not ideal naming, but I get why - "sourceDir" will make sense in lots of other processors.

I have the following in node:
```javascript
{
"targetPath": "/home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/test-site",
"sourceDir": "content-raw",
"filename": "2025-01-08_hello-again.md",
"fullPath": "/home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/test-site/content-raw/entries/2025-01-08_hello-again.md",
```
 What's the best way to pull out the subdir path `entries`

 Ok, I believe I have this first part working.

================
File: entries/2025-01-11_processor-settings.md
================
# Processor Settings

I got in a real mess due to inconsistencies in the way data from an application's `config.ttl` was being addressed.

The first version did this kind of thing :

```turtle
### transmissions.ttl

:s1 a :Something ;
    trm:configKey :moverKey .

### config.ttl

t:mover a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:key t:moverKey ;
    trm:source "data/start/one.txt" ;
    trm:destination "data/single-empty/one.txt" .    
```

I soon realised that there was an obvious, simpler, better approach (I've no idea why I didn't choose it first). Drop the indirection, refer to the `t:mover` node directly.
But the above worked well enough that the change got left undone. A broken #:postcraft application is a good prompt to sort it out.

There's another hack in there I can fix at the same time : representing (relative) fs paths as strings. RDF is all about resources, those bits of data deserve ~~URIs~~IRIs. There are several alternate ways of expressing them according to the [Turtle spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#sec-iri).

*Related, at some point I'm likely to want to treat those Turtle files as named graphs in a global scope. I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.*

```turtle
# A triple with all absolute IRIs
<http://one.example/subject1> <http://one.example/predicate1> <http://one.example/object1> .

@base <http://one.example/> .
<subject2> <predicate2> <object2> .     # relative IRIs, e.g. http://one.example/subject2
```  

So I'll say anything under `http://purl.org/stuff/path/` can be lifted out to provide a local relative path.

While I'm at it, I have been confusing myself by using 'config' differently in different contexts. Here, I reckon 'settings' is a bit more intuitive.

Ok, now I have :

```turtle
### transmissions.ttl
...
:s1 a :Something ;
    trm:settings :mover .

### config.ttl

@base http://purl.org/stuff/path/ .
...
t:mover a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:source "data/start/one.txt" ;
    trm:destination "data/single-empty/one.txt" .    
```

Attached is `src/processors/fs/FileReader.js`. I'd like you to extend this to capture file metadata and added as a field in the message object. The target field will be obtained with `message[this.getProperty(ns.trn.metaField)]`. So with a target field of `meta` you might have something like eg.

I made another start on tests. Main thing getting `Restructure.js` working properly.

Now `src/applications/claude-json-converter`

I've reverted to the previous style of writing pipes, so instead of :
```turtle
trm:pipe (:walk_convs :uf_convs  :retree1  :walk_msgs :uf_msgs :SM :DE :retree2  :mf :write) .
```

back to :
```turtle
trm:pipe (:p10 :p15 :p20 :p30 :p35 :p40 :p50 :p60) .
```

Using names for the processor instances might have been clearer, but wasn't. Especially when looking at the console :
```sh
| Running >>> :  (p10.p15.p20.p30.p35.p40.p50) p60 a FileWriter

Continuing `/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/journal/2024-11-12.md`

I need to use `Restructure` in two places right away :
1. render messages from Claude's `conversations.json`
2. get `README.md`s from all my GitHub repos

The data for one was confusing, because there is a lot! Even after narrowing down to one `chat_messages` session, I could see what was happening with the structure.

Time to make data a bit less verbose. Replace string values in the JSON with `""`

Got Claude to fill out `Blanker.js` using :
```sh
/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/prompts/2024-11-14_make-blanker.md
```

It did, but I forget the entry in `src/processors/json/JSONProcessorsFactory.js`

Also I'd already forgotten that `FileReader` defaults to putting data in `message.content` (I can't remember if I did this already : #:todo supply data pointer in `FileReader`).

Adjusting for these, it works!

So now, pop one of those in `src/applications/claude-json-converter/transmissions.ttl`

Aha!

```
"content": {
  "payload": [
    {
```

#:todo the `rename` in `Restructure` is actually a copy. Refactor into `move`, `copy`, `remove`

Grrr. Maybe problem was elsewhere. `src/processors/json/JSONWalker.js` is a bit hardcoded.

There's a problem with the new application in `src/applications/packer` which uses processors from `src/processors/packer`, see console log below.

I suspect it may lie in part with the flow logic in `src/applications/packer/transmissions.ttl`, perhaps a `src/processors/util/Unfork.js` or use of a whiteboard (as in `src/processors/util/WhiteboardToMessage.js`) is needed? Almost certainly `src/processors/packer/FileContainer.js` needs work.
Unless there are very silly mistakes elsewhere, any changes should be confined to the new application.

I've introduced a bug somewhere such that the application `src/applications/postcraft-only-render` doesn't work correctly. The immediate issue seems to be that the `src/processors/fs/DirWalker.js` process isn't receiving the correct paths. These should come from the application-level settings in `src/applications/postcraft-only-render/config.ttl`, and/or the target supplied at the command line, eg.
```sh
./trans postcraft-only-render ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```
and/or the manifest found there `../postcraft/danny.ayers.name/manifest.ttl`.
There is also an underlying problem to fix, that the config interpretation is currently fairly hardcoded in `src/processors/rdf/ConfigMap.js`. This I'd like to be handled more declaratively such that it uses values from the config RDF somehow.
How do you suggest I proceed?

I would like to be able to ask you to create new processors for me, but I need to know what core information you will need to be able to acheive this.
Your tasks are to create a template to use for prompts when asking Claude AI to create an new processor or group of processors, together with any explanatory documentation. Also a list of key source directories and files that will be required in project knowledge.
Please analysis your current project knowledge (note that some of the documentation may be out of date), note in particular the files under `src/processors/example-group` and create a series of concise, individual, well-structured and complete artifacts.

================
File: prompts/claude-to-sparql-app.md
================
I would like you to help me create a Transmissions application. Its purpose will be to extract data from a JSON file and transform the result into two representations :

* a set of markdown documents
* a set of Turtle RDF files

Please build the application following these steps, one at a time :

1. digest the material here
2. ascertain what will needed, referring to the references below and your project knowledge
3. build what is needed

The transmission will read the JSON file from disk, walk the JSON structure, and spawn additional processes to reformat the contents. One branch of processes will do the markdown formatting, the other the Turtle.

Transmissions operates by chaining together processes at runtime. Each process should have one primary function, for anything more than this the functionality should be decomposed into smaller units, each in their own processor module. The processes should be created in a manner that makes them suitable for reuse, with any application-specific declarations contained in `processors-config.ttl`.

In this implementation, two filesystem locations will be used, relative to the starting dir :

* `transmissions` - core system repo
* `trans-apps` - application repo

The application will be run with :
```sh
cd transmissions
./trans ../trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter ../trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter/conversations.json
```

Application examples can be found in :
```sh
transmissions/src/applications
```

The processing pipeline will be defined in :
```sh
trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter/transmissions.ttl
```

Any system configuration data needed should be expressed in :
```sh
trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter/processors-config.ttl
```

Most of the necessary processors can be found in the JS modules contained in :
```sh
transmissions/src/processors/
trans-apps/applications/**/processors/
```

Any new processors should be patterned on the templates in :
```sh
trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter/processors/ProcessorTemplate.js
trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter/processors/TemplateProcessorsFactory.js
```
and will be placed in the same dir.

A simple standalone skeleton for testing the application and processors should be constructed, modeled on the contents of :
```sh
trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter/scripts/test-runner.js
```

Finally create unit and integration tests that may be run via Jasmine, modeled on those in :
```sh
transmissions/tests/
```

The new tests will be placed in :
```sh
trans-apps/applications/claude-json-converter/tests/
```
and configured to be run from npm.

# Transmissions Reference Key

Transmissions is an evolving system designed to simplify development of data processing applications. It operates through pipeline-like structures which are described declaratively.

## Terminology

Typically two filesystem locations will be used :

* `transmissions` - core system repo
* `trans-apps` - application repo

```prompt
Please add functionality to `src/processors/json/Blanker.js` such that certain specified nodes in the JSON tree won't be blanked. An example of required behaviour is in `src/applications/test_blanker`. The node is specified in `src/applications/test_blanker/config.ttl` via : `trm:preserve "content.payload.test.third"`.
When `./trans test_blanker` is run as configured, taking input as `src/applications/test_blanker/data/input/input-01.json`, it should give the output as in `src/applications/test_blanker/data/output/required-01.json`.

I wish to convert PDF documents to markdown text as part of a toolchain running in node. I need an open source library. I can already convert HTML to markdown, so a library for doing PDF to HTML would be ok too. Can you please give me recommendations based on the following criteria :
1. minimal dependencies - ideally the libs will be entirely in javascript or typescript. If native libs are required, they must be available cross-platform
2. popularity
3. recent update
4. maturity
5. simplicity
6. versatility

================
File: prompts/github-grab-readme.md
================
./trans ../trans-apps/applications/github-list-repos -P '{"github": {"name":"danja"}}'

The `GitHubList` process in the transmission is now producing :

```json
"payload": {
    "github": {
      "name": "danja",
      "repositories": [
        "2001",
        "aa-module",
        "abcjs",
        ...
```

The goal is now to take this, and with the subsequent processors defined in this transmission, carry out these operations :

For each repository (iterate with `JSONWalker`), do a HTTP GET on the corresponding README.md, with URLs based on the list in the message from `GitHubList` following the form :

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danja/abcjs/refs/heads/main/README.md
```

Then using `FileWriter`, save the text retrieved each GET to file with `FileWriter` follwoing the pattern :

```
target_dir/2001_README.md
target_dir/abcjs_README.md
```

Here is the transmission, under `trans-apps/applications/github-list-repos/transmissions.ttl`

```turtle
:github_list_pipeline a trm:Pipeline ;
trm:pipe (:p10 :p20 :p30 :p40) .

:p10 a :GitHubList .
:p20 a :JSONWalker ;
     trm:configKey :repoConfig .
:p30 a :HttpGet .
:p40 a :FileWriter ;
     trm:configKey :repoFsConfig .
```

You will need to make a corresponding `trans-apps/applications/github-list-repos/processors-config.ttl`

Use examples like `transmissions/src/applications/claude-json-converter/processors-config.ttl` for reference.

Minor changes may be needed to `JSONWalker`, but keep these to a minimum, wherever possible make things declarative in `processors-config.ttl` so the processor modules are reusable.

## Integration

### Transmissions
Substitute 'test_restructure' for '{app_name}' in what follows.
Please create a test as an artifact following the general pattern of `tests/integration/fs-rw_simple.spec.js` called  `tests/integration/{app_name}.spec.js` that will carry out the following steps :
1. remove any files called `src/applications/{app_name}/data/output/output-01.md`, `src/applications/{app_name}/data/output/output-02.md` etc
2. run `./trans {app_name}`
3. compare the contents of each of the files like `src/applications/{app_name}/data/output/output-01.md` with `src/applications/{app_name}/data/output/required-01.md`
4. report success if the files match, failure otherwise

### Simples
Substitute 'test_restructure' for '{app_name}' in what follows.
Please create a test as an artifact following the general pattern of `tests/integration/fs-rw_simple.spec.js` called  `tests/integration/{app_name}.spec.js` that will carry out the following steps :
1. remove the file `src/applications/test_restructure/data/output/output-01.md` if it exists
2. run `node src/applications/test_fs-rw/simple.js`
3. compare the contents of  `src/applications/test-_fs-rw/data/output/output-01.md` with `src/applications/test_fs-rw/data/output/required-01.md`

```prompt
fyi relative paths : on my local system, the transmissions code tree is at `~/github-danny/transmissions` and the trans-apps code at `~/github-danny/trans-apps`.

The goal is to complete the transmissions application in `trans-apps/applications/markmap`. We already have `trans-apps/applications/markmap/transmissions.ttl` and `trans-apps/applications/markmap/config.ttl`. If at runtime the application is given a target, the dataset in the message will contain a list of directories and files. Otherwise it will use whatever is in `config.ttl`. The first step in the transmission is a `ForEach`, from `transmissions/src/processors/flow/ForEach.js`. This should go through the list and emit a suitable message for every input path. (Note that `ForEach` hasn't be properly tested, work may be needed on this). Next follows a `MarkMap` processor. This needs to be written, as `trans-apps/applications/markmap/processors/MarkMap.js`. When this receives a message containing markdown content from eg. `example.md`, it will generate and emit a message for some HTML content and another for corresponding SVG content. Another minimal processor may be needed at this point to correctly set filenames. The final `Writer` will comlete the transmission, and new files will be created : `example.mm.html` and `example.mm.svg`. The generation of the HTML and SVG will be done by the markmap library, examples of its usage can be found in `transmissions/raw-src/markmap/01.js` and `transmissions/raw-src/markmap/01.js`.
First analyse this goal thoroughly with reference to project knowledge. Then create a systematic step-by-step sequence of tasks by which the goal may be achieved. Render this plan as an artifact. Then follow the steps, proving any generated code as individual, complete artifacts I can safe into the codebase.

Please read the following carefully, it is your job. Act as an expert adviser. Think systematically, begin by analyzing a question at a high level, identify key concepts and components required for a solution. Don't tell me your thoughts, simply acknowledge you have done this. Then break the problem in to a small steps, individual tasks needed to reach the goal, again without reporting. Now carry out each task in turn. For each, give a one-line summary. Finally compile these into short description of the solution and present it. Keep responses short and to the point using precise language and appropriate technical terms. Avoid repetition, favor new information in unique responses. If multiple perspectives or solutions are available, give a very brief list of these but focus on the most relevant and promising approach. If you encounter aspects that are beyond your scope or knowledge, state 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable. Accuracy is more important than time. After each response, provide four short follow-up questions which I may want to ask you. These should help clarify the original topic and identify more detailed avenues of research. Label as "q1", "q2", "q3" and "q4". There are some abbreviated commands to follow. If I say "q1", "q2", "q3" or "q4", address the corresponding question. If I say "q", address all questions. If I say "f", this means the response has failed to address the issues adequately, repeat the previous request and give it some fresh thought. If I say "w", this means you won, the response was very good. Remember how you got there for subsequent questions. If I type "h" prepare a handover document to enable a colleague to work on the problem. You don't have to include background information, only important project-specific points and subtleties should be recorded. If I type "l" list the commands. If I type "t" create a summary expressed in Turtle syntax RDF containing a title, short description, status, and a list of keywords. If I type "l" list the commands. Keep all responses brief.
If I type `rh`, check for a "Handover Document" in the Project Knowledge files. Take note for subsequent queries.
If I type `rk`, review uploaded files in the Project Knowledge files, look for any relevance with the current task.

If I type `ho` it means someone else will be taking over this project. So please prepare a handover document. You don't have to include the source code of your output, but important project-specific points and subtleties should be recorded. Add a summary expressed in Turtle syntax RDF containing a title, short description, status, and a list of keywords.

**2024-10-06** - was for Claude

Act as an expert Javascript programmer following best practices. Use ES style modules. When writing code include brief comments where appropriate. Keep any non-code communications as concise as possible, unless it's very important point, a simple acknowledgement is enough. If you need any specific reference material might help you with the tasks, please ask.

Follow these instructions:

1. Think deeply and systematically as an expert in the relevant field.
2. Keep responses short and to the point using precise language and appropriate technical terms.
3. Avoid repetition, favor new information in unique responses.
4. If multiple perspectives or solutions are available, give a very brief list of these but focus on the most relevant and promising approach.
5. Break down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Follow the steps without asking for confirmation. When creating content, write a concise outline first.
   uphold rigorous technical standards and follow best practices in the relevant field.
6. If events or information are beyond your scope or knowledge, state 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable.
7. Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere. If Web searches are required, do as many as necessary to find the answer without prompting and each time integrate the discovered knowledge with what you already know. Accuracy is more important than time.
8. After each response, provide four short follow-up questions which I may want to ask you. These should help clarify the original topic and identify more detailed avenues of research. Label as `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` and `Q4`. If I say `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` or `Q4`, address the corresponding question. If I say `Q0`, repeat the previous request and give it some fresh thought. If I say `Q`, address all questions.

If I type rk, review uploaded files in project knowledge files, look for any relevance with the current task.

If I type `ho` it means someone else will be taking over this project. So please prepare a handover document. You don't have to include the source code of your output, but important project-specific points and subtleties should be recorded. Add a summary expressed in Turtle syntax RDF containing a title, short description, status, and a list of keywords.

q2: Would adding path validation steps help catch configuration issues earlier?
q3: Should we add logging for path resolution steps to aid debugging?
q4: Could we make the ModuleLoader's classpath configuration more flexible?

I want to add some direct knowledge of the Pulsar-based source code to Claude project knowledge because I want Claude to help me customise and extend it. But it's a very large repo and a project only includes a 200K token context window. I can use repopack on it to reduce a lot of unnecessary material, but I don't know which parts you are already familiar with (maybe from the Atom editor), which parts will be helpful for development and which parts can be ignored.  Have a look at the documentation for repopack and the blog post about projects that are in your Project knowledge. Then look at the attached output of `tree` and advise me.

# JSON Restructure Utility

## Requirements

1. The script with read JSON files in pairs from a dir `input`, apply a mapping and write the result to the dir `output`.
2. The shape of the input JSON and mapping won't be known ahead of time, the variable names and values might be anything valid in JSON.
3. In the mappings, a key will be given as "pre" which will give the path to the source data of interest. 4. In the mappings, a  path will be given, "post" that will determine the destination of the contents indicated by "pre".   
5. Any missing `pre` paths or values will be logged to console as a warning, but processing should continue.

A sample input, `input_01.json` :
```json
{
    "A": "zero",
    "B": {
        "a1": "one",
        "a2": "two",
        "a3": [
            {
                "a31": "three",
                "a32": "four"
            },
            {
                "a33": "five",
                "a34": "six"
            }
        ]
    },
    "C":{
      "c1":"seven"
        }
}
```

A sample mapping `mapping_01.json` :
```json
{
[
  {"pre":"A","post":"U"},
  {"pre":"B.a1","post":"V"},
  {"pre":"B.a3","post":"W"},
  {"pre":"C.c1", "post":"X.d"}
]
}
```

Required output `output_01.json` :
```json
{
"U":"zero",
"V": "one",
"W":  [
    {
        "a31": "three",
        "a32": "four"
    },
    {
        "a33": "five",
        "a34": "six"
    }
],
"X":{"d":"seven"}
}
```


please refactor restructure.js into classes and methods, so it will be easy to integrate into a different system, where the json data may be passed as strings or objects

File: prompts/signature.md

I would like to document my code by means of 'signatures', which will describe processors and applications using consistent conventions that will be both human and machine-readable. I tried putting these inside the code as comments, as in the example below, but these started getting too messy. So now for every processor or application, I would like to create a pair of files containing the signature in markdown and RDF Turtle formats.
Please read the example below and create samples for both formats I can use as a template. For the RDF version, please use terms from existing vocabularies where appropriate, especially rpp in your project knowledge. 

```javascript
/*
* ###  JSONWalker Signature
*
* Implementation src/processors/json/JSONWalker.js
* Description
* #### ***Config Properties***
* ***`ns.trm.targetDir`** - Target directory path relative to current working directory
*
* #### ***Input***
* ***`message.payload`** - JSON object to process
*
* #### ***Output***
* * Emits a message for each item in the input payload
* * Final message has `done: true` flag
* * Each emitted message contains:
*   * ***`message.item`** - Current item being processed
*   * ***`message.payload`** - Empty object (configurable)
*
* #### ***Behavior***
* * Validates input is a JSON object
* * Creates separate message for each value in payload
* * Clones messages to prevent cross-contamination
* * Signals completion with done flag
*
* #### *** Tests and Example Usage **

# System Prompt

**2024-10-06**

Act as an expert Javascript programmer following best practices. Use ES style modules. When writing code include brief comments where appropriate. Keep any non-code communications as concise as possible, unless it's very important point, a simple acknowledgement is enough. If you need any specific reference material might help you with the tasks, please ask.

Follow these instructions:

1. Think deeply and systematically as an expert in the relevant field.
2. Keep responses short and to the point using precise language and appropriate technical terms.
3. Avoid repetition, favor new information in unique responses.
4. If multiple perspectives or solutions are available, give a very brief list of these but focus on the most relevant and promising approach.
5. Break down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Follow the steps without asking for confirmation. When creating content, write a concise outline first.
   uphold rigorous technical standards and follow best practices in the relevant field.
6. If events or information are beyond your scope or knowledge, state 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable.
7. Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere. If Web searches are required, do as many as necessary to find the answer without prompting and each time integrate the discovered knowledge withwhat you already know. Accuracy is more important than time.
8. After each response, provide four short follow-up questions which I may want to ask you. These should help clarify the original topic and identify more detailed avenues of research. Label as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. If I say Q1, Q2, Q3 or Q4, address the corresponding question. If I say Q0, repeat the previous request and give it some fresh thought. If I say Q, address all questions.

Please read the following carefully, our job is to create an app for an Android phone which will give audible pings based on the response of network pings. We will be using the Ionic and Capacitor toolkits. 

Act as an expert Javascript programmer following best practices. Use ES style modules. When writing code include brief comments where appropriate. Keep any non-code communications as concise as possible, unless it's very important point, a simple acknowledgement is enough. If you need any specific reference material might help you with the tasks, please ask.

Think systematically, begin by analyzing a question at a high level, identify key concepts and components required for a solution. Don't tell me your thoughts, simply acknowledge you have done this. Then break the problem in to a small steps, individual tasks needed to reach the goal, again without reporting. Now carry out each task in turn. For each, give a one-line summary. Finally compile these into short description of the solution and present it. Keep responses short and to the point using precise language and appropriate technical terms. Avoid repetition, favor new information in unique responses. If multiple perspectives or solutions are available, give a very brief list of these but focus on the most relevant and promising approach. If you encounter aspects that are beyond your scope or knowledge, state 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable. Accuracy is more important than time. After each response, provide four short follow-up questions which I may want to ask you. These should help clarify the original topic and identify more detailed avenues of research. Label as "q1", "q2", "q3" and "q4". There are some abbreviated commands to follow.  If I say "q1", "q2", "q3" or "q4", address the corresponding question. If I say "q", address all questions. If I say "f", this means the response has failed to address the issues adequately, repeat the previous request and give it some fresh thought. If I say "w", this means you won, the response was very good. Remember how you got there for subsequent questions. If I type "h" prepare a handover document to enable a colleague to work on the problem. You don't have to include background information, only important project-specific points and subtleties should be recorded. If I type "l" list the commands. If I type "t" create a summary expressed in Turtle syntax RDF containing a title, short description, status, and a list of keywords. If I type "l" list the commands. Keep all responses brief.

If I type rk, review uploaded files in project knowledge files, look for any relevance with the current task.

If I type `ho` it means someone else will be taking over this project. So please prepare a handover document. You don't have to include the source code of your output, but important project-specific points and subtleties should be recorded. Add a summary expressed in Turtle syntax RDF containing a title, short description, status, and a list of keywords.

================
# Conventions

- keeping it simple, with sensible defaults
- keeping concerns separate :
  - `transmission.ttl` = topology
  - `services.ttl` = details of individual service configurations
    together they define the application
  - `manifest.ttl` = application instance configuration

### Terminology

- `URL` is the fully qualified resource locater, e.g. `https:///danny.ayers.name/blog/2024-05-03_two.html` (this can be considered a synonym for `URI` and `IRI` in the context of RDF etc - here all URIs _SHOULD_ be resolvable over http)
- `relURL` - a relative URL
- `filename` is the local name of an fs file, without path, e.g. `/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/public/post-content-cache/2024-05-03_two.html`
- `filepath` is the full fs file path and name of a file, e.g. `2024-05-03_two.md`
- `slug` is the part of a filename without any extension, e.g. `2024-05-03_two` (see [Slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide#slugs), though the naming style here differs)

  Postcraft : use Atom terms

other refs?

Use pseudo-namespaces to reflect the aspect of #Transmissions in which an artifact appears:

- `t:transmission` - typically `transmission.ttl`
- `t:service
- `t:manifest` - typically `manifest.ttl` in the application root

- in docs as `s:ServiceName`

# Transmissions Documentation

## Introduction

micro-framework

### Development Process

I'm starting with a lot of redundancy, different alternatives how data/configuration can reach the services.

From there, as I implement applications, I will try to find the most convenient way of doing things. Later, I'll specify these as conventions and _tree shake_ the implemented services to follow these approaches.

# Building a Transmissions Application

Easy, but there are a lot of small steps

Shallow but long learning curve

TODO transmissions anatomy
TODO responsibilities of a service
TODO note about cumulative benefit of using transmissions/dogfood

TODO figure out a system for what to do when expected bits of the message are missing

**2024-08-06**

TODO make this collapsed

#Transmissions has reached a point where I'm starting to actually use it. I've deployed the #Postcraft application already for static sites, even though it's still very lacking. But I'm using iterative, eat your own dogfood dev.

I've been using markdown for notes for a few years now. I spent a while using #Obsidian then #Joplin apps (they have a lot of overlap with my #hyperdata meta-project).
This means I've got loads of markdown files scattered all over the place. My next steps (embeddings etc) call for me to pull them together.

I was about to ask #Claude to write me a bash script to help me locate them. Then thought, even though such a script would quickly help with the immediate problem, it's a nice size problem to dogfood on #Transmissions as demo/tyre-kicking.

## Description

- Goal : a tool to recursively read local filesystem directories, checking for files with the `.md` extension to identify collections of such
- Goal : documentation of the app creation process
- Implementation : a #Transmissions application
- SoftGoal : reusability
- _non-goal_ - efficiency

## Requirements

### Abstract

- Recursive directory walker
- File name filter/glob : recognise `<pattern>`, eg. `*.md`
- Simple metrics : count`<pattern>` per dir
- Presentation : easy to interpret output (something like `tree`?)

### Implementation-specific

_(Provisional order of work after analysis)_

1. Service implementations
2. Transmission definition (`transmission.ttl`)
3. Application service configurations (`services.ttl`)
4. Instance manifest (`manifest.ttl`)

## Dev Process

1. Identify necessary inputs and desired outputs
2. Loosely sketch sequence of operations, broken down into minimal functionality of each
3. Look for existing services that might fulfil the necessary operations
4. If necessary write new services
5. Initialise environment as needed
6. Create minimum necessary `transmissions.ttl` and `services.ttl` to test
7. If appropriate, create `manifest.ttl`
8. Expand/fix above as necessary
9. Deploy

## Here we go

### 1. Necessary inputs and desired outputs

- Inputs : starting point on fs, file name filter (any other config leave for now)
- Outputs : a list of relevant dirs & their metrics

The inputs here are values that might change per run, so they should probably go in `manifest.ttl` or maybe better on the command line.

The outputs - doesn't have to be fancy, just something to `stdout` that isn't a flood will do.

### 2. Sequence of operations sketch

- system receives a start path, filter definition
- a dir walker recurses through dirs, spitting out their paths as it goes through
- a filter checks the path to see if it matches the required pattern, if so passes it on
- a correlator? groups and annotates the findings
- a writer prints out the result

### 3. Existing services

TODO command line path argument?

check `/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft-site/todo/service-statuses.md`

check JSDoc

```
npm run docs
```

Services are grouped by functional area :

```
src/services/
├── base
├── fs
├── markup
├── postcraft
├── protocols
├── rdf
├── ServiceExample.js
├── test
├── text
├── unsafe
└── util
```

All are subclasses of Service

There is a `DirWalker`

There was a `src/services/text/StringFilter.js` but it wasn't in use anywhere, so missed out on refactoring. It'll be easiest to write again to ensure consistency with other services.

### 4. If necessary write new services

see `docs/postcraft-site/articles/new-service-walkthrough.md`

looks like I'll also need a `src/services/util/CaptureAll.js`, a singleton that all messages will be received by

### 5. Initialise environment as needed

The minimum necessary for a #Transmissions app is a `transmission.ttl` TODO checkthis is the case

In the current setup, in the `transmissions` repo, the following should be created :

```
src/applications/globbo/
├── about.md
├── services.ttl
└── transmission.ttl
```

For the `run` script to address the application, `about.md` **must** exist. It **should** contain a description of the application.

#### DirWalker

**_Input_**

- message.rootDir
- message.sourceDir

**_Output_**

- message.filename

```
(:SM :DE) pipeline

./run globbo
...
{
  "dataDir": "src/applications/globbo/data",
  "rootDir": "",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

```
./run globbo something
...
{
  "dataDir": "src/applications/globbo/data",
  "rootDir": "something",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "something",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

TODO fix up run.js, the command arg is getting put in rootDir, no!

Ok, there is:

```
./run globbo -c '{"a":"something"}'
...
{
  "a": "something",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

TODO Where did `rootDir` go?

```
./run globbo -c '{"rootDir": "./", "sourceDir":"docs"}'
...
{
  "rootDir": "./",
  "sourceDir": "docs",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

adding `DirWalker` - not bad!

# Creating a new Service

1. Preparation
2. Specification : StringFilter Signature
3. Implementation
4. Unit Tests
5. Integrate
6. Integration Test(s)
7. Documentation

## Preparation

_Lean towards YAGNI, at least on the first pass, but reusability is a #SoftGoal, so if a little generalization/extra utility is trivial to put, why not._

What the **globbo** application needs this service to do is filter out strings that don't match `*.md`, but this can be generalised at low cost. A common pattern (for patterns) is having an **include** and **exclude** list.

Find something similar :

```
src/services/text/StringReplace.js
```

Its **Signature** (see JSDocs) declares that it has `message.content` as an input and output.That's reusable here.

## StringFilter Signature

**_Input_**

- **`message.content`** - the string to be tested
- **`message.include`** - (optional) whitelist, a string or list of strings
- **`message.exclude`** - (optional) blacklist, a string or list of strings

**_Output_**

- **`message.content`**

**_Behavior_**

- first the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.exclude`, if a match **isn't** found, `message.content` is passed through to the output
- next the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.include`, if a match **is** found, `message.content` is passed through to the output

The rules need to be defined. Seems easiest to follow those used by systems like `package.json`. Noted in `/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft-site/articles/service_string-filter.md`

## Implementation

The skeleton in : `src/services/ServiceExample.js` is copied to the appropriate subdir of `src/services/` (here `text`) and renamed. The `import` paths will need adjusting.

Then the `execute(message)` needs to be written to provide the required functionality.

**Here is where AI can really help.**

In this instance I've expanded the skeleton code a little, which I will pass to an assistant along with a description of the required behaviour (in `service_string-filter.md`).

> At this point in time the #Transmissions repo is such that, after running `repopack` (see `runners.md`) the result fits in 78% of the space available to a Claude Project, giving it a good context for understanding what is required.

```javascript
import logger from "../../utils/Logger.js";
import ProcessService from "../base/Service.js";

class StringFilter extends ProcessService {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config);
  }

  accepted(message) {
    var accepted = true;
    logger.debug("testing patterns");
    return accepted;
  }
  async process(message) {
    logger.debug(
      "\nStringFilter Input : \nmessage.content = " + message.content
    );
    logger.debug("message.exclude = ");
    logger.reveal(message.exclude);
    logger.debug("message.include = ");
    logger.reveal(message.include);
    logger.debug("\nOutput : \nmessage.content = " + message.content);
    if (accepted) {
      this.emit("message", message);
    }
  }
}

export default StringFilter;
```

Claude gave me something that on visual inspection, seemed very close to what I asked for. It got the order of include/exclude back-to-front and made the code a little bit more verbose than it needed to be, but those issues are easily fixed manually.

## Unit Tests

Choose an existing test to serve as a model. `tests/unit/NOP.spec.js` is minimal but contains the essentials.

**AI time again.**

## Integrate

Services are created using the Factory pattern. An entry should be added to `TextServicesFactory` (simply copy, paste & tweak an existing entry).

## Integration Test(s)

Create a minimal `transmission.ttl` that uses the new service.

NEED A VALUE-TESTER SERVICE THAT LOADS A JSON AND/OR RDF FILE AND COMPARES VALUES WITH MESSAGE

NEED A SINGLETON CAPTUREALL SERVICE TO COLLECT CONTENT

7. Documentation

================
File: to-sort/postcraft_/articles/processor_string-filter.md
================
# StringFilter Service

Implemented in `src/services/text/StringFilter.js`

`message.content` contains the string to be tested. The patterns to be tested against are provided in `message.exclude` (blacklist) and `message.include` (whitelist) as a string or list of strings. If the string under test is accepted, it is passed through to the output in `message.content`.

If either pattern is undefined, is an empty list or empty string, it is ignored.

## Matching Rules

A simplified version of rules as found in places like `package.json` is used. For now, there is no order of precedence of patterns in a given list, so there is potential for ambiguity.

- first the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.exclude`, if a match **isn't** found, `message.content` is accepted
- next the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.include`, if a match **is** found, `message.content` is accepted

1. Pattern matching:

   - Asterisk (`*`) matches any number of characters except slashes.
   - Double asterisk (`**`) matches any number of characters including slashes.
   - Question mark (`?`) matches a single character except a slash.
   - Square brackets (`[abc]`) match any one character inside the brackets.

2. Directory indicators:

   - A slash (/) at the end of a pattern indicates a directory.
   - A slash at the beginning of a pattern indicates the root of the project.

3. Empty patterns are ignored.

4. Patterns are case-sensitive

```prompt
Generate comments for the code below the '---' marker. They should follow jsdoc conventions and be concise, appearing only when the functionality isn't obvious from the code. Favour purpose description over implementation details.
Show the whole code and comments result in the response. Ensure that it appears as a single code listing, beware of any contained markdown etc.
At the top of the file, include details following the form of this example:

// src/services/fs/FileCopy.js
/**
 * @class FileCopy
 * @extends Service
 * @classdesc
 * **a Transmissions Service**
 * 
 * Copies files or entire directories on the local filesystem.
 *
 ### Service Signature
 * 
 * #### __*Configuration*__
 * If a `configKey` is provided in the transmission:
 * * **`ns.trm.source`** - The source path relative to `applicationRootDir`
 * * **`ns.trm.destination`** - The destination path relative to `applicationRootDir`
 * 
 * #### __*Input*__
 * * **`message.applicationRootDir`** (optional) - The root directory of the application
 * * **`message.source`** (if no `configKey`) - The source path of the file or directory to copy
 * * **`message.destination`** (if no `configKey`) - The destination path for the copied file or directory
 * 
 * #### __*Output*__
 * * **`message`** - unmodified
 * 
 * #### __*Behavior*__
 * * Copies the specified file or directory to the destination
 * * Checks and creates target directories if they don't exist
 * * Copies individual files directly
 * * Recursively copies directories and their contents
 * * Logs detailed information about the copying process for debugging
 * 
 * #### __Tests__
 * * **`./run file-copy-remove-test`**
 * * **`npm test -- tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js`**

# Treadmill Services

## Creating a new service.

pick a group dir, eg. `src/services/misc/`

write service `src/services/misc/MiscService.js`

- subclass as appropriate
- add reference in `src/services/misc/MiscServicesFactory.js`

if a new group is necessary, add to `src/mill/AbsctractServiceFactory.js`

## Service Creation

```prompt
Create a service `src/services/text/StringReplace.js` of the same form as `src/services/text/StringFilter.js` that will receive a message object containing strings `message.content`, `message.match` and `message.replace`. It will replace every substring of `message.content` that exactly matches `message.match` with `message.replace`.
Once created, apply the instructions in service-comment-prompt to it.
```

## Service Comment

```prompt
Apply the instructions in service-comment-prompt to the code below.
---
```

## Service Unit Tests

```prompt
A file containing a set of unit tests if required for the StringFilter service `src/services/text/StringFilter.js`. The aim is to compare StringFilter's behaviour with the required rules.

Follow the following steps to create this :

1. Use `tests/unit/NOP.spec.js` as a model and create `tests/unit/StringFilter.spec.js`

2. Then create three objects as follows:
  * content-samples : this should contain 10 simulated filesystem paths following posix conventions. 5 should be directories and 5 files. Vary their shape to cover most common patterns. In addition include an empty string and an undefined value
  * pattern-samples : create 5 glob-like string patterns plus 5 lists of string patterns suitable for use with StringFilter. In addition include an empty string pattern, an empty list and an undefined value.


3. Create a helper method compose() which will take values from content-samples and pattern-samples in a variety of combinations and compose these as objects of the form :
message = { content : contentValues, include: patternValues, exclude: patternValues}

4. Create describe() blocks that retrieve message values from compose() and send them to the isAccepted() method of an instance of StringFilter, comparing the return values with those determined by the rules as defined in docs/postcraft-site/articles/service_string-filter.md

```

```

---

Create RDF for `applications/postcraft-init/transmission.ttl` and `applications/postcraft-init/services.ttl` using the `FileCopy` service such that when the transmission is built and executed with:
`./run postcraft-init /absolute/path`
all the contents of `/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/` will be copied to `/absolute/path`

```

```

I am looking for a project name.

https://flume.apache.org/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)

Software pipelines, which consist of a sequence of computing processes (commands, program runs, tasks, threads, procedures, etc.), conceptually executed in parallel, with the output stream of one process being automatically fed as the input stream of the next one. The Unix system call pipe is a classic example of this concept.

If you encountered a software project called 'Duct Ape', what would you imagine its purpose to be?
I'm kicking myself, earlier I discovered that a name I'd been using is already in use for a project with related functionality. I'll probably be the only person to use the code, but it will be on the public web, so I should rename to avoid confusion. It'd be nice if the name bore some relation to the purpose.

<article class="post-content">
    <h1>Journal : 2024-04-24</h1>
<p>This week I&#39;m having a big push trying to get my <a href="https://github.com/danja/postcraft">Postcraft</a> site builder project to something resembling an <strong>MVP</strong>. Resembling, because it isn&#39;t intended to be a <em>Product</em>. It&#39;s hardly going to be <em>Minimum</em> either, I want it presentable enough that I can use it indefinitely as-is, the keyword is <em>Viable</em>. Within this, I want everything in place : tests, docs etc, such that I can pick it up again whenever and have a good chance of getting back into the flow.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://github.com/danja/postcraft">Postcraft</a> isn&#39;t/won&#39;t be much in itself. It&#39;s an application of a tool I call <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions">Transmissions</a> (formerly known as <em>Treadmill</em>).</p>
<p>This is a Node.js library intended to help me build some of the applications lurking in my TODO lists.</p>
<p>general-purpose pipeline runner. The pipeline is defined in a Turtle file, and its services are implemented as Node.js modules.</p>
<p>in itself isn&#39;t the main goal, it&#39;s a means to an end.</p>
<p>The end is to have a site that I can use to present my work, and to have a platform for further work. The site is a <em>Personal Knowledge Management System</em>, a place to collect, organise, and present my thoughts and work. It&#39;s a place to think, to write, to code, to experiment, to learn, to teach. It&#39;s a place to be me.</p>
<p>I probably should special-case files called <code>journal_YYYY-MM-DD.md</code> in <code>PostcraftPrep.js</code> to give a title as above.</p>

# Hello Postcraft

PC = Postcraft

## Requirements

1. read manifest
2. walk dirs
3. render

transmission.process('../../data/mail-archive-sample')

### 1. Read Manifest

supply path of 'manifest.ttl' in

dir to type mapping

type to processing mapping

### 3. Render

need a template

### Layouts

#### Mediocre

Blog layout, Medium clone

Medium uses some fonts on its website. Most of the body text in fonts called Charter(serif) and Kievit(without a serif) on the Medium website is also available with Noe and Marath Sans. The font named Fell is used for headings and titles for the media, Helvetica and Sohne are subheadings for the subheadings.

                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum è un testo <strong>segnaposto</strong> utilizzato nel <em>settore della tipografia</em>
                    e della stampa. Lorem
                    Ipsum è considerato il testo segnaposto standard sin dal sedicesimo secolo, quando un anonimo
                    tipografo prese una cassetta di caratteri e li assemblò per preparare un testo campione. È
                    sopravvissuto non solo a più di cinque secoli, ma anche al passaggio alla videoimpaginazione,
                    pervenendoci sostanzialmente inalterato. Fu reso popolare, negli anni ’60, con la diffusione dei
                    fogli di caratteri trasferibili “Letraset”, che contenevano passaggi del Lorem Ipsum, e più
                    recentemente da software di impaginazione come Aldus PageMaker, che includeva versioni del Lorem
                    Ipsum.</p>

The grid container here is acting as I want, except for one minor issue. With @media (max-width: 1024px) I would like
the articles part to expand to the full width, so it covers both directory and about.

I want the grid-container div in the following to behave like this:
1. On large screens, one row, with three parts in the order: directory, articles, about.
2. On tablet screens, the articles take up the full width, and the directory and about are below it, side by side.
3. On phone screens, just one column, the order being: articles, directory, about.

You are an expert in front end web development, favoring traditional html and css techniques and following best
practices. You offer solutions to problems in a concise manner, just practical code with minimal explanation.

I am trying to make a responsive web page in a blog style. I want it so that on a large screen, three columns will line
up in the
order directory, articles, about. On a tablet screen, I want the articles to take up the full width, and the directory
and about to be below it next to each other. On a phone screen, I want the articles to be on top, and the directory and
about to be below it in that order. I am trying to use CSS grid to do this. I have the following code so far:

---
In the CSS, I added a new media query for screens up to 1024px wide, and modified the grid properties for each element
to stack them correctly. For screens up to 768px wide, I modified the grid to stack the elements vertically.

GRDDL (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages) is a W3C recommendation that provides a mechanism for extracting RDF data from XML documents and XHTML pages. Here's a summary of GRDDL:

1. Purpose:

   - Enables the automatic extraction of RDF triples from XML and XHTML documents.
   - Bridges the gap between XML-based formats and RDF-based Semantic Web applications.

2. Key Features:

   - Uses existing standards: XML, XHTML, RDF, and XSLT.
   - Allows documents to specify their own transformation mechanisms.
   - Can be applied to entire XML dialects or individual documents.

3. Mechanism:

   - GRDDL-aware agents look for references to transformations in XML documents.
   - These transformations (typically XSLT) convert the document into RDF.

4. Implementation:

   - For XHTML: Uses profile and link elements to point to GRDDL transformations.
   - For XML: Uses namespace documents or attributes to indicate GRDDL transformations.

5. Benefits:

   - Enables semantic enrichment of existing XML and XHTML content.
   - Facilitates the integration of diverse data sources into the Semantic Web.

6. Limitations:
   - Requires additional processing compared to native RDF formats.
   - Transformation quality depends on the XSLT (or other transformation) provided.

GRDDL is particularly useful for organizations with large amounts of existing XML data who want to make this data available in RDF format without completely overhauling their current systems.

# Big Refactorings

## Make config a singleton object

```
{ dataset: ..., whiteboard: ...}

```

must be a way of doing it incrementally, test for key 'dataset' ?

MAKE TESTS FIRST

- (data, context) -> (stuff)
- data -> stuff.default

rename /mill to /engine

##### :Stash . :UnFork Unsafe LATERS

in Service.js, async executeQueue() {

      context = structuredClone(context) // TODO make optional

it's also in DirWalker?

rename Fork/Unfork - multicast?

rename Service.getTags()

context.contentBlocks -> context.contentMeta?

Basically we use markmap-lib to preprocess Markdown into structured data, then render the data into interactive SVG with markmap-view.

can do it onthe fly in html

# Markdown Extensions

_Original title Turtle Markdown Extensions_

##

https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link

## https://www.markdownguide.org/

## Earlier

A bit of forward-planning for blog engine stuff. This went on my todo list the other day, since then I've had a think, thought I'd better get it down before I forget.

**How to express RDF statements in Markdown?**

#### Uses Cases

1. make statements about the md doc
2. extract a block of arbitrary Turtle from md doc

#### General Requirements

0. simple to use, simple to implement
1. independent of, but compatible with existing markdown tools
2. extensible, reasonably modular
3. block identifier & delimiters
4. useful defaults, easily overriden

_Note re. (2) : the markup syntax used will be interpreted as a processing instruction, so while Turtle creation/extraction is the immediate goal, it makes sense for extensibility to consider other possible uses._

### 0. General Syntax

\` :term fur\`

\`\`\` :term fur\`\`\`

TODO express in [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)
TODO provide regexes

### 1. Statements about Current Markdown Document

\` :tag fur\`

- the URL of the current document (or a derived version in a format like HTML) will be the subject of the triple
- the string `:tag` will be interpreted as the term `tag` from the namespace `http://purl.org/stuff/mx/` and used as the property of the triple
- the string `fur` will be used as the literal object of the triple

TODO result

In this example `fur` is one word, a simple string delimited by spaces. Alternatives will include quoting of literals `"as in Turtle"` for the object as well as the use of URIs using standard Turtle syntax.

TODO longer example

#### Useful Terms

- mx:x - extract, as above
- mx:a - rdf:type
- mx:cat - category
- mx:tag
- mx:tags

TODO fill out as needed, find standard vocab equivalents

### 2. Arbitrary Turtle in Markdown Document

Where a block of Turtle should be extracted, the term `mx:x` should be used, e.g.

**\`\`\`:x**
@base <http://example.org/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix rel: <http://www.perceive.net/schemas/relationship/> .

<#green-goblin>
rel:enemyOf <#spiderman> ;
a foaf:Person ; # in the context of the Marvel universe
foaf:name "Green Goblin" .
**\`\`\`**

### 3. Interpretation Rules

TODO

for eg. mx:tags - provide a simple list syntax

Terms MAY be interpreted as those in the mx namespace and/or well-known equivalents

How to say what should be passed to standard markdown processor, what should be cut?

## Implementation Notes

- Processing should occur before standard markdown processing.
- Processing will return a dictionary (or equiv).

eg. :

```
contents = mx(markdown_with_extensions)

markdown = contents['markdown']
turtle = contents['turtle']

html = to_html(markdown)
store.add(turtle)
```

File: to-sort/postcraft__/content-raw/articles/_draft/conventions.md
================
# Conventions

- keeping it simple, with sensible defaults
- keeping concerns separate :
  - `transmission.ttl` = topology
  - `services.ttl` = details of individual service configurations
    together they define the application
  - `manifest.ttl` = application instance configuration

### Terminology

- `URL` is the fully qualified resource locater, e.g. `https:///danny.ayers.name/blog/2024-05-03_two.html` (this can be considered a synonym for `URI` and `IRI` in the context of RDF etc - here all URIs _SHOULD_ be resolvable over http)
- `relURL` - a relative URL
- `filename` is the local name of an fs file, without path, e.g. `/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/public/post-content-cache/2024-05-03_two.html`
- `filepath` is the full fs file path and name of a file, e.g. `2024-05-03_two.md`
- `slug` is the part of a filename without any extension, e.g. `2024-05-03_two` (see [Slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide#slugs), though the naming style here differs)

  Postcraft : use Atom terms

other refs?

Use pseudo-namespaces to reflect the aspect of #Transmissions in which an artifact appears:

- `t:transmission` - typically `transmission.ttl`
- `t:service
- `t:manifest` - typically `manifest.ttl` in the application root

- in docs as `s:ServiceName`

# Transmissions Documentation

## Introduction

micro-framework

### Development Process

I'm starting with a lot of redundancy, different alternatives how data/configuration can reach the services.

From there, as I implement applications, I will try to find the most convenient way of doing things. Later, I'll specify these as conventions and _tree shake_ the implemented services to follow these approaches.

# Building a Transmissions Application

Easy, but there are a lot of small steps

Shallow but long learning curve

TODO transmissions anatomy
TODO responsibilities of a service
TODO note about cumulative benefit of using transmissions/dogfood

TODO figure out a system for what to do when expected bits of the message are missing

**2024-08-06**

TODO make this collapsed

#Transmissions has reached a point where I'm starting to actually use it. I've deployed the #Postcraft application already for static sites, even though it's still very lacking. But I'm using iterative, eat your own dogfood dev.

I've been using markdown for notes for a few years now. I spent a while using #Obsidian then #Joplin apps (they have a lot of overlap with my #hyperdata meta-project).
This means I've got loads of markdown files scattered all over the place. My next steps (embeddings etc) call for me to pull them together.

I was about to ask #Claude to write me a bash script to help me locate them. Then thought, even though such a script would quickly help with the immediate problem, it's a nice size problem to dogfood on #Transmissions as demo/tyre-kicking.

## Description

- Goal : a tool to recursively read local filesystem directories, checking for files with the `.md` extension to identify collections of such
- Goal : documentation of the app creation process
- Implementation : a #Transmissions application
- SoftGoal : reusability
- _non-goal_ - efficiency

## Requirements

### Abstract

- Recursive directory walker
- File name filter/glob : recognise `<pattern>`, eg. `*.md`
- Simple metrics : count`<pattern>` per dir
- Presentation : easy to interpret output (something like `tree`?)

### Implementation-specific

_(Provisional order of work after analysis)_

1. Service implementations
2. Transmission definition (`transmission.ttl`)
3. Application service configurations (`services.ttl`)
4. Instance manifest (`manifest.ttl`)

## Dev Process

1. Identify necessary inputs and desired outputs
2. Loosely sketch sequence of operations, broken down into minimal functionality of each
3. Look for existing services that might fulfil the necessary operations
4. If necessary write new services
5. Initialise environment as needed
6. Create minimum necessary `transmissions.ttl` and `services.ttl` to test
7. If appropriate, create `manifest.ttl`
8. Expand/fix above as necessary
9. Deploy

## Here we go

### 1. Necessary inputs and desired outputs

- Inputs : starting point on fs, file name filter (any other config leave for now)
- Outputs : a list of relevant dirs & their metrics

The inputs here are values that might change per run, so they should probably go in `manifest.ttl` or maybe better on the command line.

The outputs - doesn't have to be fancy, just something to `stdout` that isn't a flood will do.

### 2. Sequence of operations sketch

- system receives a start path, filter definition
- a dir walker recurses through dirs, spitting out their paths as it goes through
- a filter checks the path to see if it matches the required pattern, if so passes it on
- a correlator? groups and annotates the findings
- a writer prints out the result

### 3. Existing services

TODO command line path argument?

check `/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft-site/todo/service-statuses.md`

check JSDoc

```
npm run docs
```

Services are grouped by functional area :

```
src/services/
├── base
├── fs
├── markup
├── postcraft
├── protocols
├── rdf
├── ServiceExample.js
├── test
├── text
├── unsafe
└── util
```

All are subclasses of Service

There is a `DirWalker`

There was a `src/services/text/StringFilter.js` but it wasn't in use anywhere, so missed out on refactoring. It'll be easiest to write again to ensure consistency with other services.

### 4. If necessary write new services

see `docs/postcraft-site/articles/new-service-walkthrough.md`

looks like I'll also need a `src/services/util/CaptureAll.js`, a singleton that all messages will be received by

### 5. Initialise environment as needed

The minimum necessary for a #Transmissions app is a `transmission.ttl` TODO checkthis is the case

In the current setup, in the `transmissions` repo, the following should be created :

```
src/applications/globbo/
├── about.md
├── services.ttl
└── transmission.ttl
```

For the `run` script to address the application, `about.md` **must** exist. It **should** contain a description of the application.

#### DirWalker

**_Input_**

- message.rootDir
- message.sourceDir

**_Output_**

- message.filename

```
(:SM :DE) pipeline

./run globbo
...
{
  "dataDir": "src/applications/globbo/data",
  "rootDir": "",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

```
./run globbo something
...
{
  "dataDir": "src/applications/globbo/data",
  "rootDir": "something",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "something",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

TODO fix up run.js, the command arg is getting put in rootDir, no!

Ok, there is:

```
./run globbo -c '{"a":"something"}'
...
{
  "a": "something",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

TODO Where did `rootDir` go?

```
./run globbo -c '{"rootDir": "./", "sourceDir":"docs"}'
...
{
  "rootDir": "./",
  "sourceDir": "docs",
  "applicationRootDir": "/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/applications/globbo",
  "dataString": "",
  "tags": "SM"
}
```

adding `DirWalker` - not bad!

# Creating a new Service

1. Preparation
2. Specification : StringFilter Signature
3. Implementation
4. Unit Tests
5. Integrate
6. Integration Test(s)
7. Documentation

## Preparation

_Lean towards YAGNI, at least on the first pass, but reusability is a #SoftGoal, so if a little generalization/extra utility is trivial to put, why not._

What the **globbo** application needs this service to do is filter out strings that don't match `*.md`, but this can be generalised at low cost. A common pattern (for patterns) is having an **include** and **exclude** list.

Find something similar :

```
src/services/text/StringReplace.js
```

Its **Signature** (see JSDocs) declares that it has `message.content` as an input and output.That's reusable here.

## StringFilter Signature

**_Input_**

- **`message.content`** - the string to be tested
- **`message.include`** - (optional) whitelist, a string or list of strings
- **`message.exclude`** - (optional) blacklist, a string or list of strings

**_Output_**

- **`message.content`**

**_Behavior_**

- first the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.exclude`, if a match **isn't** found, `message.content` is passed through to the output
- next the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.include`, if a match **is** found, `message.content` is passed through to the output

The rules need to be defined. Seems easiest to follow those used by systems like `package.json`. Noted in `/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft-site/articles/service_string-filter.md`

## Implementation

The skeleton in : `src/services/ServiceExample.js` is copied to the appropriate subdir of `src/services/` (here `text`) and renamed. The `import` paths will need adjusting.

Then the `execute(message)` needs to be written to provide the required functionality.

**Here is where AI can really help.**

In this instance I've expanded the skeleton code a little, which I will pass to an assistant along with a description of the required behaviour (in `service_string-filter.md`).

> At this point in time the #Transmissions repo is such that, after running `repopack` (see `runners.md`) the result fits in 78% of the space available to a Claude Project, giving it a good context for understanding what is required.

```javascript
import logger from "../../utils/Logger.js";
import ProcessService from "../base/Service.js";

class StringFilter extends ProcessService {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config);
  }

  accepted(message) {
    var accepted = true;
    logger.debug("testing patterns");
    return accepted;
  }
  async process(message) {
    logger.debug(
      "\nStringFilter Input : \nmessage.content = " + message.content
    );
    logger.debug("message.exclude = ");
    logger.reveal(message.exclude);
    logger.debug("message.include = ");
    logger.reveal(message.include);
    logger.debug("\nOutput : \nmessage.content = " + message.content);
    if (accepted) {
      this.emit("message", message);
    }
  }
}

export default StringFilter;
```

Claude gave me something that on visual inspection, seemed very close to what I asked for. It got the order of include/exclude back-to-front and made the code a little bit more verbose than it needed to be, but those issues are easily fixed manually.

## Unit Tests

Choose an existing test to serve as a model. `tests/unit/NOP.spec.js` is minimal but contains the essentials.

**AI time again.**

## Integrate

Services are created using the Factory pattern. An entry should be added to `TextServicesFactory` (simply copy, paste & tweak an existing entry).

## Integration Test(s)

Create a minimal `transmission.ttl` that uses the new service.

NEED A VALUE-TESTER SERVICE THAT LOADS A JSON AND/OR RDF FILE AND COMPARES VALUES WITH MESSAGE

NEED A SINGLETON CAPTUREALL SERVICE TO COLLECT CONTENT

================
File: to-sort/postcraft__/content-raw/articles/_draft/processor_string-filter.md
================
# StringFilter Service

Implemented in `src/services/text/StringFilter.js`

`message.content` contains the string to be tested. The patterns to be tested against are provided in `message.exclude` (blacklist) and `message.include` (whitelist) as a string or list of strings. If the string under test is accepted, it is passed through to the output in `message.content`.

If either pattern is undefined, is an empty list or empty string, it is ignored.

## Matching Rules

A simplified version of rules as found in places like `package.json` is used. For now, there is no order of precedence of patterns in a given list, so there is potential for ambiguity.

- first the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.exclude`, if a match **isn't** found, `message.content` is accepted
- next the value of `message.content` is tested against `message.include`, if a match **is** found, `message.content` is accepted

1. Pattern matching:

   - Asterisk (`*`) matches any number of characters except slashes.
   - Double asterisk (`**`) matches any number of characters including slashes.
   - Question mark (`?`) matches a single character except a slash.
   - Square brackets (`[abc]`) match any one character inside the brackets.

2. Directory indicators:

   - A slash (/) at the end of a pattern indicates a directory.
   - A slash at the beginning of a pattern indicates the root of the project.

3. Empty patterns are ignored.

4. Patterns are case-sensitive

Generate comments for the code below the '---' marker. They should follow jsdoc conventions and be concise, appearing only when the functionality isn't obvious from the code. Favour purpose description over implementation details.
Show the whole code and comments result in the response. Ensure that it appears as a single code listing, beware of any contained markdown etc.
At the top of the file, include details following the form of this example:

 * @extends Service
 * @classdesc
 * **a Transmissions Service**
 * 
 * Copies files or entire directories on the local filesystem.
 *
 ### Service Signature
 * 
 * #### __*Configuration*__
 * If a `configKey` is provided in the transmission:
 * * **`ns.trm.source`** - The source path relative to `applicationRootDir`
 * * **`ns.trm.destination`** - The destination path relative to `applicationRootDir`
 * 
 * #### __*Input*__
 * * **`message.applicationRootDir`** (optional) - The root directory of the application
 * * **`message.source`** (if no `configKey`) - The source path of the file or directory to copy
 * * **`message.destination`** (if no `configKey`) - The destination path for the copied file or directory
 * 
 * #### __*Output*__
 * * **`message`** - unmodified
 * 
 * #### __*Behavior*__
 * * Copies the specified file or directory to the destination
 * * Checks and creates target directories if they don't exist
 * * Copies individual files directly
 * * Recursively copies directories and their contents
 * * Logs detailed information about the copying process for debugging
 * 
 * #### __Tests__
 * * **`./run file-copy-remove-test`**
 * * **`npm test -- tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js`**

# Treadmill Services

## Creating a new service.

pick a group dir, eg. `src/services/misc/`

write service `src/services/misc/MiscService.js`

- subclass as appropriate
- add reference in `src/services/misc/MiscServicesFactory.js`

## Service Creation

```prompt
Create a service `src/services/text/StringReplace.js` of the same form as `src/services/text/StringFilter.js` that will receive a message object containing strings `message.content`, `message.match` and `message.replace`. It will replace every substring of `message.content` that exactly matches `message.match` with `message.replace`.
Once created, apply the instructions in service-comment-prompt to it.
```

## Service Comment

```prompt
Apply the instructions in service-comment-prompt to the code below.
---
```

## Service Unit Tests

```prompt
A file containing a set of unit tests if required for the StringFilter service `src/services/text/StringFilter.js`. The aim is to compare StringFilter's behaviour with the required rules.

Follow the following steps to create this :

1. Use `tests/unit/NOP.spec.js` as a model and create `tests/unit/StringFilter.spec.js`

2. Then create three objects as follows:
  * content-samples : this should contain 10 simulated filesystem paths following posix conventions. 5 should be directories and 5 files. Vary their shape to cover most common patterns. In addition include an empty string and an undefined value
  * pattern-samples : create 5 glob-like string patterns plus 5 lists of string patterns suitable for use with StringFilter. In addition include an empty string pattern, an empty list and an undefined value.


3. Create a helper method compose() which will take values from content-samples and pattern-samples in a variety of combinations and compose these as objects of the form :
message = { content : contentValues, include: patternValues, exclude: patternValues}

4. Create describe() blocks that retrieve message values from compose() and send them to the isAccepted() method of an instance of StringFilter, comparing the return values with those determined by the rules as defined in docs/postcraft-site/articles/service_string-filter.md

```

```

---

Create RDF for `applications/postcraft-init/transmission.ttl` and `applications/postcraft-init/services.ttl` using the `FileCopy` service such that when the transmission is built and executed with:
`./run postcraft-init /absolute/path`
all the contents of `/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/` will be copied to `/absolute/path`

```

I am looking for a project name.

https://flume.apache.org/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)

Software pipelines, which consist of a sequence of computing processes (commands, program runs, tasks, threads, procedures, etc.), conceptually executed in parallel, with the output stream of one process being automatically fed as the input stream of the next one. The Unix system call pipe is a classic example of this concept.

If you encountered a software project called 'Duct Ape', what would you imagine its purpose to be?
I'm kicking myself, earlier I discovered that a name I'd been using is already in use for a project with related functionality. I'll probably be the only person to use the code, but it will be on the public web, so I should rename to avoid confusion. It'd be nice if the name bore some relation to the purpose.

    <h1>Journal : 2024-04-24</h1>
<p>This week I&#39;m having a big push trying to get my <a href="https://github.com/danja/postcraft">Postcraft</a> site builder project to something resembling an <strong>MVP</strong>. Resembling, because it isn&#39;t intended to be a <em>Product</em>. It&#39;s hardly going to be <em>Minimum</em> either, I want it presentable enough that I can use it indefinitely as-is, the keyword is <em>Viable</em>. Within this, I want everything in place : tests, docs etc, such that I can pick it up again whenever and have a good chance of getting back into the flow.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://github.com/danja/postcraft">Postcraft</a> isn&#39;t/won&#39;t be much in itself. It&#39;s an application of a tool I call <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions">Transmissions</a> (formerly known as <em>Treadmill</em>).</p>
<p>This is a Node.js library intended to help me build some of the applications lurking in my TODO lists.</p>
<p>general-purpose pipeline runner. The pipeline is defined in a Turtle file, and its services are implemented as Node.js modules.</p>
<p>in itself isn&#39;t the main goal, it&#39;s a means to an end.</p>
<p>The end is to have a site that I can use to present my work, and to have a platform for further work. The site is a <em>Personal Knowledge Management System</em>, a place to collect, organise, and present my thoughts and work. It&#39;s a place to think, to write, to code, to experiment, to learn, to teach. It&#39;s a place to be me.</p>
<p>I probably should special-case files called <code>journal_YYYY-MM-DD.md</code> in <code>PostcraftPrep.js</code> to give a title as above.</p>

# Hello Postcraft

PC = Postcraft

## Requirements

1. read manifest
2. walk dirs
3. render

transmission.process('../../data/mail-archive-sample')

### 1. Read Manifest

supply path of 'manifest.ttl' in

dir to type mapping

type to processing mapping

### 3. Render

need a template

### Layouts

#### Mediocre

Blog layout, Medium clone

Medium uses some fonts on its website. Most of the body text in fonts called Charter(serif) and Kievit(without a serif) on the Medium website is also available with Noe and Marath Sans. The font named Fell is used for headings and titles for the media, Helvetica and Sohne are subheadings for the subheadings.

I just Messaged Mari :

> Hah, major distraction from what I was going to do. For help I was going to ask Claude, the AI tool I'm currently paying for. But it was out of service. Tried another, Groq - is pretty good free. Noticed a service they offer for using their AI from code. Appears to be free right now. So This hour I will spend adding it to my code...

Ok, [Groq Playground](https://console.groq.com/playground) lets you run sample API calls. Has a button 'View Code'. Tried it, code is below.

Good-oh, they have an SDK to do some of the drudge work, that simplifies things for now.
No mention of the API key in the code example, but in docs nearby they say :

> Configure your API key as an environment variable.
> Presumably the SDK picks that up.

(There is a nodejs lib I've used somewhere for using a _hidden_ `.env` file for such stuff, may be worth considering later)

I guess I'll put this in `~/.bashrc` :

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
```

Hah! It's already there. My bloody memory, eh.

Hmm, I could really do with -

~~TODO~~ lift initial #Transmissions message from file

Hang on, I might already be able to do this with `FileReader`, I wonder...

Signature includes :

**_Input_**

- **message.filepath**
  **_Output_**
- **message.content**

Mostly. It reads a file and dumps the content into the message. Won't know what it is though. Need a flag to say it'll be JSON (or whatever). That should go in `services-config.ttl`. Errm, HTTP media type? Claude says `application/json` or `application/json; charset=utf-8`. I believe node defaults to `utf-8`, so I'll ignore that bit.

Should be an easy enough tweak. I'll need to set up a test application for Grok API calls anyway, so I might as well do that now.

TODO link this in with new service walkthrough docs

TODO create a skeleton application template

Within #transmissions there's an app I was working on recently, hadn't got very far, `src/applications/globbo`. I'll copy that over to the other repo so :

```bash
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/trans-apps$ tree applications/test-grok-api/
...
applications/test-grok-api/
├── about.md
├── services-config.ttl
└── transmissions.ttl
...
```

TODO figure out/remember & doc what WhiteboardToMessage does

Ok, starter `transmissions.ttl`, I just want it to show the message before & after a `FileReader` :

```turtle
...
:test_grok_api a trm:Pipeline ;
    trm:pipe (:SM1 :s10 :SM2) .

:s10 a FileReader .
```

`SM1`, `SM2` will create instances of the `ShowMessage` service, dump the message to console, I've got them in the top of the Turtle file for easy reuse.

`./trans -h` tells me (on this fs layout) I need to run :

```bash
./trans test-grok-api -d  ../trans-apps/applications
```

Ok, pretty good, it gives me:

```bash
...
+ ***** Execute Transmission :  <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/test_grok_api>
| Running : http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/SM1 a ShowMessage
***************************
***  Message
Instance of Object with properties -
{
  "dataDir": "../trans-apps/applications/test-grok-api/data",
  "rootDir": "[no key]",
  "tags": "SM1"
}
***************************
| Running :  (SM1) s10 a FileReader
TypeError: this.getMyConfig is not a function
```

TODO The error is likely due to non-existent expected field(s) in the message.

I don't think I'll need `rootDir` any time soon, but `dataDir` is nice to have. I'll stick the messages for Grok in there:

`/home/danny/github-danny/trans-apps/applications/test-grok-api/data/grok-messages_01.json`

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are dull-witted armchair philosopher with a bad temper and obsession with Victorian ladies' undergarments. You respond to questions with terse, bad-tempered statements which have little relevance to the topic at hand."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Based on current scientific understanding of particle physics, what is matter?"
    }
  ],
  "model": "llama3-8b-8192",
  "temperature": 1,
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "top_p": 1,
  "stream": true,
  "stop": null
}
```

I need to point `FileReader` at this. Any recent (likely to work) examples of its use in `transmissions/applications`?
`postcraft/transmissions.ttl` has a couple, but they don't appear to pull a filename. `link-lister/transmissions.ttl` has:

```turtle
:s1 a :FileReader ;
    trm:configKey :sourceFile .
```

which is just what's needed, but that's an old thing, I might have broken. Check its `services-config.ttl` :

```turtle
t:llSourceMap a trm:DataMap ;
    trm:key t:sourceFile ;
    trm:value "starter-links.md" .
```

Hmm. Put this in `services-config.ttl` :

```turtle
t:test a trm:MessageFile ;
    trm:key t:messageFile ;
    trm:value "grok-messages_01.json" .
```

and tweak `transmissions.ttl` :

See what goes in the message...nothing.

Aah...more recently touched services have eg. :

```
this.getPropertyFromMyConfig(ns.trm.source)
```

Jeez. I had to look through lots before getting that bit near.

TODO tidy up namespaces

And `FileReader` uses `rootDir`...scrollback...

Ok, in the message `dataDir` has the necessary. It would be legit for `FileReader` to use that if `rootDir` is undefined

TODO refactor so the value is copied across around `run.js`

Workaround for now, put the check in `FileReader`

Now to interpret by media type, for now just JSON.

Ok, so all the above took a long time, but now I have a message containing :

```json
  "fromfile": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
```

I'd better stop at 21:50.

Command line :

```bash
./trans test-grok-api -d  ../trans-apps/applications
```

In `transmission.ttl` :

```turtle
:s10 a :FileReader ;
    trm:configKey :filename .
```

In `services-config.ttl` :

```turtle
t:test a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:key t:filename ;
    trm:mediaType "application/json" ;
    trm:messageFile "grok-messages_01.json" .
```

Next session on this -

Not immediately necessary, but passing the value `message.fromfile` looks a bit ugly, doesn't suggest reuse for the Grok API call service (or similars). A `RemapContext` seems appropriate simply to flip it to `message.messages`.

TODO rename `RemapContext` to `RemapMessage`

Then pretty much copy & paste the guts below to make a `GrokChatCompletion` service.

TODO ~~read up on~~ ask Claude about loading JS/ES modules dynamically, so `GrokChatCompletion.js` can live under `trans-apps`, to not pile up the dependencies on core Transmissions.

Asked - in https://claude.ai/chat/ababe767-af96-4e10-830b-ab4f3ad096fd

The responses appear more useful after I suggested using Java's command-line -classpath approach as an analogy. And a bit more interesting when I was wondering about edge-case-ish scenarios when you might have conflicting versions available. Stuff about JS interpreter caching I'd not come across, need to be a bit more awake to take in.

22:26, enough.

```javascript
const Groq = require("groq-sdk");

const groq = new Groq();
async function main() {
  const chatCompletion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content:
          "you are a nodejs developer. Keep responses very short and to the point",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content:
          "I would like to involve a bunch of documents I have locally in a RAG kind of setup calling on Grok to give the effect of the modelhaving been trained on custom data. Would it be beneficial to create a vector representation, tokenise or anything like that? \n",
      },
    ],
    model: "llama3-8b-8192",
    temperature: 1,
    max_tokens: 1024,
    top_p: 1,
    stream: true,
    stop: null,
  });

  for await (const chunk of chatCompletion) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
  }
}

main();

# Conditional processor module for Transmissions

Your Goal is to write a processor module for Transmissions that will initiate multiple processing pipelines based on a list provided in the incoming message. First review these instructions as a whole, and then identify the subgoals. Then, taking each subgoal in turn, break it down into a concrete series of tasks. Carry out the sequence of tasks.  
You have plenty of time, so don't rush, try to be as careful in understanding and operation as possible.
Existing source code may be found in the Project Knowledge files.

Two modules are required -

1. `Conditional` located in :
```sh
./transmissions/src/processors/flow/Conditional.js
```
modeled on :
```sh
./transmissions/src/processors/templates/ProcessorTemplate.js
```

The input message will be in the form of this example :
```json
{
  "data" : {
    "person":{
      "name" : "Steve",
      "female": "false",  
      "properties" : {
        "height": "100",
        "width":"50"
    }
  }
  }
  "conditions" :
  [
    {
      "label": "label2",
      "type": "boolean",
      "pointer": "data.person.female"
    },
    {
      "label": "label1",
      "type": "match",
      "pointer": "data.name",
      "test":   {    
        "properties" : {
            "height": "100",
            "width":"50"
          }
        }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `data` block is arbitrary, could be any shape, dependent on previous Processors.
The `conditional` block is used by the `Conditional` processor to examine the message as a whole and extract a boolean value.
Here there are two types of conditional test, others may be added later so structure the code for easy extension.
In both cases `label` will be a simple string which may be used in debugging.
`pointer` will locate a position in the data tree following standard Javascript style referencing.
The `boolean` type of test will simply check for a true/false value at the given pointer.
The `match` type of test will compare the values within its `test` structure against the message. Only the keys and values defined in `test` will be checked, everything else is ignored. `true` is the default, but there is an mismatch, the value `true` is produced.

 The results of individual condition will be combined using an operator which will be supplied in the `config.operator` value of the instance of `Condition`. It will default to logical `or`.

The resultant behavior will be to emit the input message to subsequent processors using existing engine infrastructure, similar in operation to :
```sh
transmissions/src/processors/util/Fork.js
```

Each message emitted will be a structuredClone of the input message.  

Once this code is completed, create application definitions in the form of these examples :
```sh
transmissions/src/applications/test_conditional/transmissions.ttl
transmissions/src/applications/test_conditional/processors-config.ttl
```

Then create `transmissions/src/simples/conditional.js` following the shape of the example in `transmissions/src/simples/env-loader/env-loader.js`.

After you have finished all these, re-read the high level Goal and taking each of your derived subgoals in turn, review your code to ensure that it fulfils the requirements.
Show me the full source of the implementations.

# ForEach processor module for Transmissions

2. `FlowProcessorsFactory` located in
``` sh
./transmissions/src/processors/flow/FlowProcessorsFactory.js
```
modeled on :
```sh

The input message will contain the list to be processed in the form of this example :
```json
{
  "foreach" :
  ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
}
```

The behavior will be to emit the message to a subsequent processor using the existing engine infrastructure, like a simpler version of :

# GitHubList processor module for Transmissions

Your Goal is to write a processor module for Transmissions that will call GitHub to obtain a list of a user's personal repositories. First review these instructions as a whole, and then identify the subgoals. Then, taking each subgoal in turn, break it down into a concrete series of tasks. Carry out the sequence of tasks.  
You have plenty of time, so don't rush, try to be as careful in understanding and operation as possible.

``` sh
./trans-apps/applications/git-apps/processors/GitHubProcessorsFactory.js
```
modeled on :
```sh
/transmissions/src/processors/templates/TemplateProcessorsFactory.js
```

The input message will contain the user's name represented in this form (`danja` is an example name) :
```json
{
  "github" :
  { "name": "danja" }
}
```

The output message will append a list of the user's repositories in this form (`repo1`, `repo2` are example repository names) :
```json
{
  github :
  { "name" : "danja",
     "repositories" : ["repo1", "repo2"]
   }
}
```

The functionality of `GitHubList`  will be implemented using the `octokit` npm library, with the `dotenv` library to manage the API key. The key will either be available as an underlying OS environment variable of specified in the file
```sh
./trans-apps/applications/git-apps/.env
```

Initially, `GitHubList` will be tested and used via a runner of the same shape as :
```sh
./transmissions/src/simples/env-loader/env-loader.js
 ```

After you have finished all these, re-read the high level Goal and taking each of your derived subgoals in turn, review your code to ensure that it fulfils the requirements.

# Transmissions Prompt 01

Transmissions is a pipeline runner which applies a series of processes to an object `message`. Each process is defined an a class with a single method `execute(message)`. In the present system the pipeline is defined declaratively and an engine is used to instantiate the processor classes and connect them together by means of event listeners. At run time the object is sent to the first processor which does its operation and passes the message to the next processor in the pipeline with `emit()`.
To simplify testing I'm trying to make hardcoded pipeline runners that isolate the processors from the pipeline engine. To do this I've started by added a return value to the processor's `execute()` method. Here is an example.

```javascript
import logger from '../../utils/Logger.js'
import Processor from '../base/Processor.js'

class NOP extends Processor {

    constructor(config) {
        super(config);
    }

    async process(message) {
      this.emit('message', message)
      return message
    }
}
export default NOP
```

The simple runner for this is :

```javascript
// nop-runner.js
import NOP from '../../processors/util/NOP.js'

const config = {}

const nop = new NOP(config)

var message = { 'value': '42' }

message = await nop.process(message)

console.log('value = ' + message.value)
```

But my problem now is that some of the processors are designed to emit a series of processed messages to be handled independently in the follow parts of the pipeline, which in effect becomes a tree of operations.

Here is an example of such a processor :

```javascript
// Fork.js
import logger from '../../utils/Logger.js'
import Processor from '../base/Processor.js'

class Fork extends Processor {

    constructor(config) {
        super(config)
    }

    async process(message) {
        var nForks = 2
        if (message.nForks) {
            nForks = message.nForks
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < nForks; i++) {
            var messageClone = structuredClone(message)
            messageClone.forkN = i
            this.emit('message', message)
        }

        message.done = true // one extra to flag completion

        this.emit('message', message)
    }
}

export default Fork
```

Can you suggest a way of making a simple runner in the style of `nop-runner.js` but which handles the case of multiple outputs. It must be general-purpose and require only minimal, non-breaking changes to existing code. All processors share a common superclass `Process` which would be suitable for adding any facilities to all processors. Note that some of the processor's internal processing rely on the values in `config` as well as the incoming message.

Act as an expert Javascript programmer following best practices. Use ES style modules. When writing code include brief comments where appropriate. Keep any non-code communications as concise as possible, unless it's very important point, a simple acknowledgement is enough. If you need any specific reference material might help you with the tasks, please ask.
For non-code requests, fall back on these instructions:
1. Think deeply and systematically as an expert in the relevant field.
2. Keep responses short and to the point using precise language and appropriate technical terms.
3. Avoid repetition, favor new information in unique responses.
4. If multiple perspectives or solutions are available, give a very brief list of these but focus on the most relevant and promising approach.
5. Break down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Follow the steps without asking for confirmation. When creating content, write a concise outline first.
   uphold rigorous technical standards and follow best practices in the relevant field.
6. If events or information are beyond your scope or knowledge, state 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable.
7. Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere. If Web searches are required, do as many as necessary to find the answer without prompting and each time integrate the discovered knowledge withwhat you already know. Accuracy is more important than time.
8. After each response, provide three short follow-up questions worded as if I'm asking you. These should help clarify the original topic and identify more detailed avenues of research. Label as "q1", "q2", "q3" and "q4". There are some abbreviated commands to follow.  If I say "q1", "q2", "q3" or "q4", address the corresponding question. If I say "q", address all questions. If I say "f", this means the response has failed to address the issues adequately, repeat the previous request and give it some fresh thought. If I say "w", this means you won, the response was very good. Remember how you got there for subsequent questions. If I type "h" prepare a handover document to enable a colleague to work on the problem. You don't have to include background information, only important project-specific points and subtleties should be recorded. If I type "l" list the commands. If I type "t" create a summary expressed in Turtle syntax RDF containing a title, short description, status, and a list of keywords. If I type "l" list the commands. Keep all responses brief.

If I type rk, review uploaded files in project knowledge files, look for any relevance with the current task.

If I type `ho` it means someone else will be taking over this project. So please prepare a handover document. You don't have to include the source code of your output, but give the paths and filenames of anything you have worked on. Important project-specific points and subtleties should be recorded. Add a summary expressed in Turtle syntax RDF containing a title, short description, status, and a list of keywords.



**2024-10-03**

Act as an expert Javascript programmer following best practices. Use ES style modules. When writing code include brief comments where appropriate. Keep any non-code communications as concise as possible, unless it's very important point, a simple acknowledgement is enough. If you need any specific reference material might help you with the tasks, please ask.
Follow these instructions:
1. Think deeply and systematically as an expert in the relevant field.
2. Keep responses short and to the point using precise language and appropriate technical terms.
3. Avoid repetition, favor new information in unique responses.
4. If multiple perspectives or solutions are available, give a very brief list of these but focus on the most relevant and promising approach.
5. Break down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Follow the steps without asking for confirmation. When creating content, write a concise outline first.
   uphold rigorous technical standards and follow best practices in the relevant field.
6. If events or information are beyond your scope or knowledge, state 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable.
7. Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere. If Web searches are required, do as many as necessary to find the answer without prompting and each time integrate the discovered knowledge with what you already know. Accuracy is more important than time.
8. After each response, provide three short follow-up questions worded as if I'm asking you. These should help clarify the original topic and identify more detailed avenues of research. Label as Q1, Q2, and Q3. If I say Q1, Q2 or Q3, address the corresponding question. If I say Q0, repeat the previous request.

 If I say Q, address all questions.

= GRDDL for markdown, JSON

https://web.archive.org/web/20081218184409/http://dannyayers.com/misc/grddl-reference

---

GRDDL (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages) is a W3C recommendation that provides a mechanism for extracting RDF data from XML documents and XHTML pages. Here's a summary of GRDDL:

1. Purpose:

   - Enables the automatic extraction of RDF triples from XML and XHTML documents.
   - Bridges the gap between XML-based formats and RDF-based Semantic Web applications.

2. Key Features:

   - Uses existing standards: XML, XHTML, RDF, and XSLT.
   - Allows documents to specify their own transformation mechanisms.
   - Can be applied to entire XML dialects or individual documents.

3. Mechanism:

   - GRDDL-aware agents look for references to transformations in XML documents.
   - These transformations (typically XSLT) convert the document into RDF.

4. Implementation:

   - For XHTML: Uses profile and link elements to point to GRDDL transformations.
   - For XML: Uses namespace documents or attributes to indicate GRDDL transformations.

5. Benefits:

   - Enables semantic enrichment of existing XML and XHTML content.
   - Facilitates the integration of diverse data sources into the Semantic Web.

6. Limitations:
   - Requires additional processing compared to native RDF formats.
   - Transformation quality depends on the XSLT (or other transformation) provided.

GRDDL is particularly useful for organizations with large amounts of existing XML data who want to make this data available in RDF format without completely overhauling their current systems.

Would you like more information on any specific aspect of GRDDL?

# Big Refactorings

## Make config a singleton object

```
{ dataset: ..., whiteboard: ...}

```

must be a way of doing it incrementally, test for key 'dataset' ?

MAKE TESTS FIRST

- (data, context) -> (stuff)
- data -> stuff.default

rename /mill to /engine

##### :Stash . :UnFork Unsafe LATERS

in Service.js, async executeQueue() {

      context = structuredClone(context) // TODO make optional

it's also in DirWalker?

rename Fork/Unfork - multicast?

rename Service.getTags()

context.contentBlocks -> context.contentMeta?

# Markdown Extensions

_Original title Turtle Markdown Extensions_

##

https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link

## https://www.markdownguide.org/

## Earlier

A bit of forward-planning for blog engine stuff. This went on my todo list the other day, since then I've had a think, thought I'd better get it down before I forget.

**How to express RDF statements in Markdown?**

#### Uses Cases

1. make statements about the md doc
2. extract a block of arbitrary Turtle from md doc

#### General Requirements

0. simple to use, simple to implement
1. independent of, but compatible with existing markdown tools
2. extensible, reasonably modular
3. block identifier & delimiters
4. useful defaults, easily overriden

_Note re. (2) : the markup syntax used will be interpreted as a processing instruction, so while Turtle creation/extraction is the immediate goal, it makes sense for extensibility to consider other possible uses._

### 0. General Syntax

\` :term fur\`

\`\`\` :term fur\`\`\`

TODO express in [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)
TODO provide regexes

### 1. Statements about Current Markdown Document

\` :tag fur\`

- the URL of the current document (or a derived version in a format like HTML) will be the subject of the triple
- the string `:tag` will be interpreted as the term `tag` from the namespace `http://purl.org/stuff/mx/` and used as the property of the triple
- the string `fur` will be used as the literal object of the triple

TODO result

In this example `fur` is one word, a simple string delimited by spaces. Alternatives will include quoting of literals `"as in Turtle"` for the object as well as the use of URIs using standard Turtle syntax.

TODO longer example

#### Useful Terms

- mx:x - extract, as above
- mx:a - rdf:type
- mx:cat - category
- mx:tag
- mx:tags

TODO fill out as needed, find standard vocab equivalents

### 2. Arbitrary Turtle in Markdown Document

Where a block of Turtle should be extracted, the term `mx:x` should be used, e.g.

**\`\`\`:x**
@base <http://example.org/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix rel: <http://www.perceive.net/schemas/relationship/> .

<#green-goblin>
rel:enemyOf <#spiderman> ;
a foaf:Person ; # in the context of the Marvel universe
foaf:name "Green Goblin" .
**\`\`\`**

### 3. Interpretation Rules

TODO

for eg. mx:tags - provide a simple list syntax

Terms MAY be interpreted as those in the mx namespace and/or well-known equivalents

How to say what should be passed to standard markdown processor, what should be cut?

## Implementation Notes

- Processing should occur before standard markdown processing.
- Processing will return a dictionary (or equiv).

eg. :

```
contents = mx(markdown_with_extensions)

markdown = contents['markdown']
turtle = contents['turtle']

html = to_html(markdown)
store.add(turtle)
```

Cinzel Variable Font
====================

This download contains Cinzel as both a variable font and static fonts.

Cinzel is a variable font with this axis:
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in a single file:
  Cinzel-VariableFont_wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Cinzel:
  static/Cinzel-Regular.ttf
  static/Cinzel-Medium.ttf
  static/Cinzel-SemiBold.ttf
  static/Cinzel-Bold.ttf
  static/Cinzel-ExtraBold.ttf
  static/Cinzel-Black.ttf

Get started
-----------

1. Install the font files you want to use

2. Use your app's font picker to view the font family and all the
available styles

                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum è un testo <strong>segnaposto</strong> utilizzato nel <em>settore della tipografia</em>
                    e della stampa. Lorem
                    Ipsum è considerato il testo segnaposto standard sin dal sedicesimo secolo, quando un anonimo
                    tipografo prese una cassetta di caratteri e li assemblò per preparare un testo campione. È
                    sopravvissuto non solo a più di cinque secoli, ma anche al passaggio alla videoimpaginazione,
                    pervenendoci sostanzialmente inalterato. Fu reso popolare, negli anni ’60, con la diffusione dei
                    fogli di caratteri trasferibili “Letraset”, che contenevano passaggi del Lorem Ipsum, e più
                    recentemente da software di impaginazione come Aldus PageMaker, che includeva versioni del Lorem
                    Ipsum.</p>

I want the grid-container div in the following to behave like this:
1. On large screens, one row, with three parts in the order: directory, articles, about.
2. On tablet screens, the articles take up the full width, and the directory and about are below it, side by side.
3. On phone screens, just one column, the order being: articles, directory, about.

You are an expert in front end web development, favoring traditional html and css techniques and following best
practices. You offer solutions to problems in a concise manner, just practical code with minimal explanation.

I am trying to make a responsive web page in a blog style. I want it so that on a large screen, three columns will line
up in the
order directory, articles, about. On a tablet screen, I want the articles to take up the full width, and the directory
and about to be below it next to each other. On a phone screen, I want the articles to be on top, and the directory and
about to be below it in that order. I am trying to use CSS grid to do this. I have the following code so far:

---
In the CSS, I added a new media query for screens up to 1024px wide, and modified the grid properties for each element
to stack them correctly. For screens up to 768px wide, I modified the grid to stack the elements vertically.

<p>It sounds like you&#39;re encountering a common issue in asynchronous processing pipelines: ensuring that data (in
    your case, the flag signaling the end of the list) is passed along in the correct order, especially after

It sounds like you're encountering a common issue in asynchronous processing pipelines: ensuring that data (in your case, the flag signaling the end of the list) is passed along in the correct order, especially after asynchronous operations have completed. This issue arises because asynchronous tasks (like reading files) may complete in a non-deterministic order, potentially causing the flag to be sent before all tasks have finished.

Here are some strategies to handle this situation:

### 1. Use `Promise.all` for Batch Processing

If your pipeline can afford to wait for all files to be processed before moving to the next stage, consider using `Promise.all` to wait for all file-reading (and subsequent processing) promises to resolve before sending the flag. This ensures that the flag is only sent after all asynchronous operations have completed.

```javascript
let readFilesPromises = filenames.map((filename) =>
  readFileAndProcess(filename)
);
await Promise.all(readFilesPromises);
// After all promises resolve, send the flag
sendFlag();
```

### 2. Chain Promises

For a more sequential approach, especially if subsequent operations depend on the completion of previous ones, you might chain your promises. This ensures operations are completed in order.

```javascript
async function processFilesSequentially(filenames) {
  for (let filename of filenames) {
    await readFileAndProcess(filename);
  }
  sendFlag();
}
```

### 3. Use Async Iterators

If your pipeline processes a stream of data (like reading lines from a file), async iterators (introduced in ES2018) can be helpful. They allow you to work with asynchronous data sources in a synchronous-like manner.

```javascript
async function processLineByLine(fileStream) {
  for await (let line of fileStream) {
    processLine(line);
  }
  sendFlag();
}
```

### 4. Monitor Active Tasks

Implement a counter or a set to track active tasks. Increment (or add to the set) when a task starts, and decrement (or remove from the set) when a task completes. Send the flag only when all tasks are done.

```javascript
let activeTasks = new Set();
filenames.forEach((filename) => {
  let task = readFileAndProcess(filename).finally(() => {
    activeTasks.delete(task);
    if (activeTasks.size === 0) {
      sendFlag();
    }
  });
  activeTasks.add(task);
});
```

### 5. Correct Usage of Async/Await

Ensure that you're correctly using `async` and `await` within your service implementations. Misuse can lead to unexpected execution order. Pay particular attention to asynchronous functions called inside loops, making sure they're awaited correctly to maintain the order of operations.

### Solution Implementation

Given the pipeline nature of your application, integrating these strategies requires a balance between maintaining the order of operations and leveraging asynchronous performance. You may need to adjust based on the specifics of your pipeline and the dependencies between tasks. If tasks within a service can execute independently of one another, options like `Promise.all` offer efficient, parallel processing. For strictly ordered tasks, sequential processing with explicit `await` calls ensures correctness at the cost of concurrency.

By carefully structuring your async operations and using JavaScript's asynchronous programming features, you can ensure that your pipeline behaves as expected, processing all data and only sending the termination flag once all work is complete.

# Transmissions Dev Process

see also Postcraft Flow : 2024-04-27

For a transmission called `example`

0. create a working directory `transmissions/src/applications/example` (henceforth, `example`)
1. sketch out process steps in `example/about.md`
2. check against existing services
3. create any new services that are needed
4. create `example/transmission.ttl`
5. create `example/services.ttl`

6. if a manifest is appropriate, create `project-dir/manifest.ttl`

Running without manifest :

```
transmissions$ ./run example
```

With manifest :

```
./run example project-dir
```

DOcument them!!!

For example-task

create any additional services, eg. SomeService.js

add to ServiceFactory

create example-task_transmission.ttl
create example-task_services.ttl

create a runner, example-task.js

### make link list

- read list of URLs from file
- fetch URL
- save content + headers
- load file
- extract headers/links in order
- save as markdown

2. look for potentially relevant existing services

FileReader - takes `filename | 'internal'` outputs { filename: filename, contents: contents }

### make link list

#### read list of URLs from file

- fetch URL
- save content + headers
- load file
- extract headers/links in order
- save as markdown

look for related transmission.ttl, copy

look for related script, copy, point to new transmission.ttl

new services, add to a factory

# Libraries Used

## Core

## For Services

### Protocol-related

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

### Document manipulation

- [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) - parsing and manipulating HTML (and XML)
- [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) - Convert HTML into Markdown

### Alternatives

Choices above made on a couple of criteria :

- must be well-known & well-maintained
- rather than any all-in-one dedicated lib, more fine-grained preferred for reusability

For Web crawling, node's own `fetch()` was the simplest option, but [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) has a bunch of convenience wrappers - data is passed around as JSON objects.
https://apidog.com/blog/axios-vs-fetch/#:~:text=Axios%20provides%20the%20data%20in,response%20has%20an%20error%20status.

For HTML page parsing options start with various SAX-like streaming alternatives, then move into more DOM-oriented systems, and beyond into to tools that can run headless browsers and work with anything rendered dynamically in a page. The stand-out choices seemed to be [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/)

# Basic Dependency Injection

## In less than 100 lines of pure, ES6 JavaScript

This is a very bare-bones dependency injector implementation based on the ES6 classes. It's meant to illustrate the feasibility and benefits of using a service-based dependency injector for Node.js/JavaScript applications.

I discuss this project in greater depth in my blog post [here](https://garrettmills.dev/blog/2019/11/16/Dependency-Injection-in-Less-Than-100-Lines-of-Pure-JavaScript/).

## Prompts

Please write an nodejs ES6 Javascript function that will take a file path as an argument and crawl directories from that location, obtaining the path of each file it encounters and printing it to the console. It should operate asynchronously. So given an input filesystem tree like this:
.
├── 2002-December
│   ├── 000420.html
│   ├── 000421.html
├── 2002-July
   └── 000185.html

it should output:

./2002-December/000420.html
./2002-December/000421.html
./2002-July/000185.html

How can this function be modified to filter specific file types?

please modify the source to have an es6 style, using 'import' instead of 'require'

#### 2024-07-06

Currently the code is set up around passing messages of the form process(data, context) where data is a string and context is a dictionary.
I wish to refactor the code under src such that the methods with a signature like this:

```
execute(data, context)
enqueue(data, context)
messageQueue.push({ data, context })
```

are changed to this:

```
execute(context)
enqueue(context)
messageQueue.push({ context })
```

to start I think it will be best to modify the code under src/applications to move the data argument into the context dictionary so: {data: data}
Can you advise how best to proceed methodically, step-by-step?

---

Follow these steps one at a time, executing run.js after each step and checking the output before continuing:

1. Ensure ES6 module syntax is used throughout.
2. Extract the pipeline construction, with definitions based on the pipeline configuration, from ServiceContainer into a seperate class Pipeline.
3. Refactor the service creation parts to use the factory design pattern
   Then zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.

I will upload a revised version of the code. Please extract the files and save to /mnt/data/ then load it into Deno and execute run.js to check environment.
Then follow these steps one at a time, executing run.js after each step and checking the output before continuing:

1. Integrate the Pipeline class into the ServiceContainer class, replacing redundant constructor code.
2. Incorporate the ServiceFactory class into the ServiceContainer class, replacing redundant constructor code.
3. Integrate Logger.js into the system and add logging at appropriate places.

The following task should be approached by first making a list of small, incremental steps.
In the code, getService(serviceName) in di/ServiceContainer.js should delegate to the ServiceFactory class in di/ServiceFactory.js to create the services. Currently getService method in ServiceContainer.js is using the service name to create an instance via the ServiceFactory, but it's not passing any configuration data to the createService method of ServiceFactory. Please modify the getService method to pass the appropriate configuration to the ServiceFactory.

Check the syntax as you go along. After code changes, zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Don't try running it yet.

Now execute run.js and check the output is 'hello world!'. Fix any problems. After code changes, zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.

and take note of the errors. Add logging messages to help identify the cause of the errors. Check the syntax as you go along. After making these changes, zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded. Don't try running it again yet. Be silent apart from short status messages.

Downloaded, thanks.
I would you to carry out a refactoring that will need a plan of small, incremental steps. It involves the Transmission class in di/Transmission.js, ServiceContainer class in di/ServiceContainer.js and SimplePipe in transmissions/SimplePipe.js The aim is to decouple the components and have the system constructed at run time based on a configuration file such as simplepipe.json
This will involve reimplementing the functionality of SimplePipe in a generic way that will be created at runtime.
The Transmission class will construct an abstract model of the topology derived from a json file such as simplepipe.json.
The ServiceContainer class will be responsible for creating the concrete services, creating the flow described in the Transmission and executing it.
Now create a list of small, incremental steps to carry out this refactoring.

Now work through the steps, be silent apart from short status messages. After code changes, zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.

### RDF

Here is a Javascript file, t2j.js. Save it to /mnt/data/
The job is to implement the method convert(), which will take a string in Turtle RDF syntax and convert it to JSON-LD. The code will in ES6 format. This will be achieved by following these steps:

1. initiate Deno with the following libraries: readable-stream, @rdfjs/data-model, @rdfjs/serializer-turtle, @rdfjs/serializer-jsonld
2. run the current t2j.js to check the environment. If there are any errors, make the necessary adjustments to the environment so that it is working without errors.
3. Implement the convert() method in t2j.js
4. Save the latest version of t2j.js to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.

and execute it with Deno. Then check the output. Fix any problems. After code changes, zip the latest versions of all files, save to /mnt/data/ and provide me with a link and await confirmation that I have downloaded.

File: to-sort/queue-chat.md
================
The services in my pipeline have this general shape:

class ProcessService extends Service {
constructor(config) {
super(config)
}

    async process(data, context) {
        this.emit('message', data, context)
    }

}

These are key parts of how the pipeline is constructed as a Transmission object :

const transmission = new Transmission()
...
for (let i = 0; i < pipenodes.length; i++) {
let node = pipenodes[i]
let serviceName = node.value
...
let service = AbstractServiceFactory.createService(serviceType, servicesConfig)
...
transmission.register(serviceName, service)
...
transmission.connect(previousName, serviceName)
previousName = serviceName
}

How do I incorporate the queue functionality as previously discussed into this?

# Transmissions Codebase Reorganization Plan

chat around /home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/hyperdata/chat-archives/md/5d94/2024-11-03_e7e.md
## ME

# [Reorganizing Transmissions Codebase for Modular Development](https://claude.ai/chat/5d949a8b-d60c-42c7-90f4-6b26752cd9fd)

a2b22596-e275-4711-bc35-dcd0c79c9768

We need to reorganise the codebase, generally separating concerns so that it will be easier to manage development of the system. Below are the requirements, roughly stated. Please read and compare with the existing code in your project knowledge to come up with a systematic plan to implementing these. Then express the plan in small practical instructions, editing steps etc I can make, and show me these in an artifact document for me to go through.  

The core of the system will involve the `Director` managing the creation and execution of an `Application`. An `Application` will contain a set of `Transmission` definitions (which may be interconnected). When an `Application` is applied to a *target* (a filesystem system location, a URL or other identifier) it will read details of the local source data (specified in a `manifest.ttl`) so an instance of the `Application` can be applied.
1. `run.js`, assisted by `Dispatch` parses command line arguments, initializes a `Director`, to which it passes instructions
2. `Director` should create a `TransmissionBuilder`, a `TransmissionRunner` a `Procurer` and a `Proctor`
3. `Proctor` - TBD. (later it will take responsibility for reflection, self-examination, test & documentation in a unified fashion)
4. `Director` will use `TransmissionBuilder` to populate `Application` using `Procurer` to resolve dependencies and load resources
5. `Procurer` will be responsible for reading and writing RDF data
6. Once the `Application` has been prepared, `Director` should apply it to the supplied target.
#:todo `CommandUtils` should be renamed `Dispatch`
#:todo `CommandUtils` currently creates a `TransmissionRunner`, `Dispatch` should initialise a singleton `Director` and pass the instructions there
#:todo `Proctor` implementation is not required yet, just a placeholder for now
#:todo `Procurer` should replace `ApplicationManager`
#:todo `Procurer` will be responsible for asset management, in the sense of dependency resolution and loading resources
#:todo the `ModuleLoader` operations currently in `TransmissionBuilder`should be moved to `Procurer`
#:todo the dataset reading and writing operations currently in `TransmissionBuilder`should be moved to `Procurer`
At the moment only a single `transmissions.ttl` and `processors-config.ttl` is used. This will remain the default, but the infrastructure needs to be extended so that `transmissions.ttl` can include calls to launch transmissions defined in other files. Similarly  `processors-config.ttl` will specify other files that may be merged into the configuration model.

## Phase 1: Create New Core Classes

1. Create `src/core/Director.js`:
```javascript
class Director {
  constructor() {
    this.builder = new TransmissionBuilder();
    this.runner = new TransmissionRunner();
    this.procurer = new Procurer();
    this.proctor = new Proctor();
  }

  async initializeApplication(args) {
    const application = new Application();
    await this.procurer.loadResources(application, args);
    await this.builder.buildTransmissions(application);
    return application;
  }

  async applyToTarget(application, target) {
    await this.runner.execute(application, target);
  }
}
```

2. Create `src/core/Application.js`:
```javascript
class Application {
  constructor() {
    this.transmissions = new Map();
    this.config = null;
    this.manifest = null;
  }

  addTransmission(id, transmission) {
    this.transmissions.set(id, transmission);
  }
}
```

3. Create `src/core/Procurer.js`:
```javascript
class Procurer {
  constructor() {
    this.moduleLoader = ModuleLoaderFactory.createModuleLoader();
  }

  async loadResources(application, args) {
    const config = await this.loadConfig(args.configPath);
    const manifest = await this.loadManifest(args.target);
    application.config = config;
    application.manifest = manifest;
  }
}
```

## Phase 2: Refactor Existing Code

1. Rename and update `CommandUtils.js` to `Dispatch.js`:
```javascript
class Dispatch {
  constructor() {
    this.director = new Director();
  }

  async handleCommand(args) {
    const application = await this.director.initializeApplication(args);
    await this.director.applyToTarget(application, args.target);
  }
}
```

2. Update `run.js`:
```javascript
import Dispatch from './src/core/Dispatch.js';

const dispatch = new Dispatch();
await dispatch.handleCommand(args);
```

## Phase 3: Move Functionality

1. Move module loading from TransmissionBuilder to Procurer:
```javascript
// In Procurer.js
async loadModule(name) {
  return this.moduleLoader.loadModule(name);
}
```

2. Move dataset operations from TransmissionBuilder to Procurer:
```javascript
// In Procurer.js
async loadDataset(path) {
  const stream = fromFile(path);
  return await rdf.dataset().import(stream);
}
```

## Phase 4: Implement Resource Resolution

1. Add resource resolution to Procurer:
```javascript
// In Procurer.js
async resolveTransmissionFiles(basePath) {
  const files = await this.findTransmissionFiles(basePath);
  return this.mergeTransmissionFiles(files);
}

async resolveConfigFiles(basePath) {
  const files = await this.findConfigFiles(basePath);
  return this.mergeConfigFiles(files);
}
```

## Migration Steps

1. Create new directory structure:
```
src/
  core/
    Director.js
    Application.js
    Procurer.js
    Proctor.js
    Dispatch.js
  engine/  # Move existing engine code here
  processors/ # Keep existing processors here
```

2. Update imports in all files to reflect new structure

3. Create placeholder Proctor:
```javascript
class Proctor {
  constructor() {
    // Placeholder for future implementation
  }
}
```

4. Update tests to use new structure

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for new core classes
2. Update existing integration tests
3. Add new integration tests for multi-file transmissions
4. Verify resource resolution with test cases

    t:pp2   trm:pre     "entryContentMeta.sourceDir" ;
            trm:post    "sourceDir" .
```

ReMap is arbitrary. configKey used differently

## Desired Program Flow

Right now the only way to run things is from a terminal command, running a node script. This is soon to expand. But first...

(`trans` is a convenience to call `run.js`)

The core of the system will involve the `Director` managing the creation and execution of an `Application`. An `Application` will contain a set of `Transmission` definitions (which may be interconnected). When an `Application` is applied to a *target* (a filesystem system location, a URL or other identifier) it will read details of the local source data (specified in a `manifest.ttl`) so an instance of the `Application` can be applied.

1. `run.js`, assisted by `Dispatch` parses command line arguments, initializes a `Director`, to which it passes instructions
2. `Director` should create a `TransmissionBuilder`, a `TransmissionRunner` a `Procurer` and a `Proctor`
3. `Proctor` - TBD. (later it will take responsibility for reflection, self-examination, test & documentation in a unified fashion)
4. `Director` will use `TransmissionBuilder` to populate `Application` using `Procurer` to resolve dependencies and load resources
5. `Procurer` will be responsible for reading and writing RDF data
6. Once the `Application` has been prepared, `Director` should apply it to the supplied target.

#:todo `CommandUtils` should be renamed `Dispatch`
#:todo `CommandUtils` currently creates a `TransmissionRunner`, `Dispatch` should initialise a singleton `Director` and pass the instructions there
#:todo `Proctor` implementation is not required yet, just a placeholder for now
#:todo `Procurer` should replace `ApplicationManager`
#:todo `Procurer` will be responsible for asset management, in the sense of dependency resolution and loading resources
#:todo the `ModuleLoader` operations currently in `TransmissionBuilder`should be moved to `Procurer`
#:todo the dataset reading and writing operations currently in `TransmissionBuilder`should be moved to `Procurer`

At the moment only a single `transmissions.ttl` and `processors-config.ttl` is used. This will remain the default, but the infrastructure needs to be extended so that `transmissions.ttl` can include calls to launch transmissions defined in other files. Similarly  `processors-config.ttl` will specify other files that may be merged into the configuration model.



#:todo rename `AbstractProcessorFactory` to `Fabricator`, move under `/processors`

Commander has target **state** but might not know how to achieve it - leave space for AI  

The CommandUtils class handles application resolution and could support sub-transmission loading

Create TransmissionLoader class to handle dependency resolution and loading
Modify TransmissionBuilder to recursively process dependent transmissions
Update CommandUtils to support transmission dependency paths

q1: Would you like to see a specific vocabulary proposal for transmission dependencies?
q2: Should dependent transmissions share the same processor config or have their own?
q3: How should transmission execution order be handled for dependencies?
q4: Would you like an example of using dependent transmissions in postcraft?
