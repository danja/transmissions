I keep running into problems related to run.js and CommandUtils.js. Also I would like to add facilities to allow the running of transmissions using a web interface, with an admin server running withing the system. This all suggests some refactoring is needed. First step, the functionality of  CommandUtils.js needs abstracting out somehow. Please think about how best to do this, then tell me the steps I need to perform to achieve this, including full source code.


q1: Should we consolidate path resolution into a single utility class?
q2: Would adding path validation steps help catch configuration issues earlier?
q3: Should we add logging for path resolution steps to aid debugging?
q4: Could we make the ModuleLoader's classpath configuration more flexible?
