# Logger


my node app is currently using a homemade hacky logger. I'd like to migrate to using the loglevel lib. To avoid breaking changes and leave options later, can you please modify Logger.js to act as a wrapper around loglevel. Attached is the Logger.js source and the README.md for loglevel. Please give me the updated Logger.js as a single artifact containing complete source code

Please make my logging easier to understand by incorporating CLI styling using the chalk lib.
