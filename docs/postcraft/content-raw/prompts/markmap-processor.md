fyi relative paths : on my local system, the transmissions code tree is at `~/github-danny/transmissions` and the trans-apps code at `~/github-danny/trans-apps`.

The goal is to complete the transmissions application in `trans-apps/applications/markmap`. We already have `trans-apps/applications/markmap/transmissions.ttl` and `trans-apps/applications/markmap/config.ttl`. If at runtime the application is given a target, the dataset in the message will contain a list of directories and files. Otherwise it will use whatever is in `config.ttl`. The first step in the transmission is a `ForEach`, from `transmissions/src/processors/flow/ForEach.js`. This should go through the list and emit a suitable message for every input path. (Note that `ForEach` hasn't be properly tested, work may be needed on this). Next follows a `MarkMap` processor. This needs to be written, as `trans-apps/applications/markmap/processors/MarkMap.js`. When this receives a message containing markdown content from eg. `example.md`, it will generate and emit a message for some HTML content and another for corresponding SVG content. Another minimal processor may be needed at this point to correctly set filenames. The final `Writer` will comlete the transmission, and new files will be created : `example.mm.html` and `example.mm.svg`. The generation of the HTML and SVG will be done by the markmap library, examples of its usage can be found in `transmissions/raw-src/markmap/01.js` and `transmissions/raw-src/markmap/01.js`.
First analyse this goal thoroughly with reference to project knowledge. Then create a systematic step-by-step sequence of tasks by which the goal may be achieved. Render this plan as an artifact. Then follow the steps, proving any generated code as individual, complete artifacts I can safe into the codebase.

I would like you to generate a prompt template that I can give to an LLM to build new transmissions apps. Please review what we have been doing here and consider how my requests could have been stated in a better manner for you, for you to carry out the necessary tasks with the minimum effort.
