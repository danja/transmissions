## Introduction

micro-framework

### Development Process

I'm starting with a lot of redundancy, different alternatives how data/configuration can reach the services.

From there, as I implement applications, I will try to find the most convenient way of doing things. Later, I'll specify these as conventions and _tree shake_ the implemented services to follow these approaches.
