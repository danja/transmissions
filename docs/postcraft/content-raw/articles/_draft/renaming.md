I am looking for a project name.

Software pipelines, which consist of a sequence of computing processes (commands, program runs, tasks, threads, procedures, etc.), conceptually executed in parallel, with the output stream of one process being automatically fed as the input stream of the next one. The Unix system call pipe is a classic example of this concept.

If you encountered a software project called 'Duct Ape', what would you imagine its purpose to be?
I'm kicking myself, earlier I discovered that a name I'd been using is already in use for a project with related functionality. I'll probably be the only person to use the code, but it will be on the public web, so I should rename to avoid confusion. It'd be nice if the name bore some relation to the purpose.
