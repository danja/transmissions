The long term plan is to facilitate interoperability between Transmissions and ComfyUI. The first phase will be to use the ComfyUI editor to create and run transmissions following the RDF Turtle model. Within transmissions some kind of interface should be added to make its processors more compatible with ComfyUI nodes. Custom nodes will be needed for ComfyUI to act as adaptors between the two message systems and to allow transmissions to be run from within ComfyUI. Figure out a step-by-step plan on how all this might be achieved, and then for each step give implementation details.

Key points for the integration:

Keep the RDF/Turtle foundation of Transmissions while adopting ComfyUI's execution model
Use eye reasoner for workflow validation and optimization
Implement proper GPU resource management
Create adapters between the two message systems
q1: Should the graph execution engine be built from scratch or adapted from ComfyUI's implementation?

q2: What's the best approach to handle tensor lifecycle management between the two systems?

q3: How should workflow validation rules be expressed in RDF/Turtle?

q4: Should the integration target ComfyUI compatibility or a new hybrid architecture?
