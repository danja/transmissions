# Overview

Claude decided to give me a diagram

docs/transmission-flow.mermaid

The diagram shows the main components of the transmission system:

Input layer handles CLI commands, config files, and input data
Core engine manages application lifecycle and builds transmissions
Processing pipeline executes processor chains with shared resources
Output layer handles file writing, API responses, and logging
