# Testes

I've got a couple of new integration tests in place using Jasmine, but realised I haven't got any facility for checking test coverage. A quick google led me to : [Jasmine Unit Tests Setup with Code Coverage for Node JS](https://medium.com/@karthiknom/jasmine-unit-tests-setup-with-code-coverage-for-node-js-5ff0d1b2781e) which uses [Istanbul Code Coverage](https://github.com/istanbuljs) via its  command line interface [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)
"nyc": {
  "report-dir": "spec/coverage",
  "exclude": [
    "spec/**/*"
  ]
}
