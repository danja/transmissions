Apply the instructions in service-comment-prompt to the code below.
---

Create a service `src/services/text/StringReplace.js` of the same form as `src/services/text/StringFilter.js` that will receive a message object containing strings `message.content`, `message.match` and `message.replace`. It will replace every substring of `message.content` that exactly matches `message.match` with `message.replace`. 
Once created, apply the instructions in service-comment-prompt to it.
---
Using `tests/unit/NOP.spec.js` as a model, create `tests/unit/StringReplace.spec.js`, including comments as appropriate.

Create RDF for `applications/postcraft-init/transmission.ttl` and `applications/postcraft-init/services.ttl` using the `FileCopy` service such that when the transmission is built and executed with:
`./run postcraft-init /absolute/path`
all the contents of `/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/` will be copied to `/absolute/path`
