Generate comments according to these conventions. They should follow jsdoc conventions and be concise. Inline comments should only appear when the functionality isn't obvious from the code or an unusual library is used. Favour purpose description over implementation details.
After the imports, preceding the class definitions, include details following the pattern of this example:

/**
 * @class PathOps
 * @extends Processor
 * @classdesc
 * **a Transmissions Processor**
 *
 * Performs path operations by combining segments from settings, supporting both path and string concatenation.
 *
 * ### Processor Signature
 *
 * #### __*Settings*__
 * * **`ns.trn.targetField`** - The target field in the message to set the result
 * * **`ns.trn.values`** - List of segments to combine (as RDF list)
 * * **`ns.trn.asPath`** - If true, segments are joined as a path; otherwise, concatenated as strings
 *
 * #### __*Input*__
 * * **`message`** - The message object, expected to contain fields referenced by segments
 *
 * #### __*Output*__
 * * **`message`** - The message object with the combined string/path set at the target field
 *
 * #### __*Behavior*__
 * * Reads segment definitions from RDF dataset, config, or transmissionConfig
 * * Combines segments as a path or string based on settings
 * * Supports extracting values from message fields or static strings
 * * Logs debug information about the process and segments
 *
 * #### __*Side Effects*__
 * * None (message is modified in place)
 *
 * #### __Tests__
 * * **`./trans -v stringops -m '{"fields": {"fieldB" : "TEST","fieldC":"_PASSED"}}'`**
 
 * #### __Example Usage__
 * :asPath true ;
 * :values (:a :b :c :d) .
 * :a :string "/home/danny/sites/strandz.it/postcraft/public" .
 * :b :field "currentItem.relPath.value" .
 * :c :field "currentItem.slug.value" .
 * :d :string ".html" .
